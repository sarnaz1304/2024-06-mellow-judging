# Access Control Flaw in  RestrictingKeeper Prevents Critical Variable Updates in VaultConfigurator

## Summary
The RestrictingKeeper contract has an access control vulnerability that allows anyone to call its `processConfigurators` function. This can prevent the protocol from changing important variables of the vault's configurator, including `BaseDelay`, `MaximalTotalSupplyDelay`, and `MaximalTotalSupply`.

## Vulnerability Detail

The VaultConfigurator contract is responsible for maintaining a series of important vault parameters, and updates are done through a two-stage process: staging and committing, with each parameter update subject to a specified delay.

In the RestrictingKeeper contract, there is a `processConfigurators` function as shown below.
```solidity
    function processConfigurators(
        VaultConfigurator[] memory configurators
    ) external {
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < configurators.length; i++) {
            VaultConfigurator configurator = configurators[i];
            configurator.rollbackStagedBaseDelay();
            configurator.rollbackStagedMaximalTotalSupplyDelay();
            configurator.rollbackStagedMaximalTotalSupply();
        }
    }
```

This contract is granted with the `ADMIN_DELEGATE_ROLE` (confirmed by the team) to invoke some rollback functions. However, the function itself is public, which means anyone can call it.

Since the variables changes in the configurator need to wait for a certain period after being staged before they can be committed, this lack of secure access control allows any malicious user to call the `processConfigurators` function during the delay period to rollback, effectively preventing any modifications to `BaseDelay`, `MaximalTotalSupplyDelay`, and `MaximalTotalSupply`.

## Impact

A malicious user can permanently prevent the protocol from correctly modifying the three important variables `BaseDelay`, `MaximalTotalSupplyDelay`, and `MaximalTotalSupply` in the configurator.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add access control to the `processConfigurators` function to check if `msg.sender` is an admin for the vault.

```solidity
    function processConfigurators(
        VaultConfigurator[] memory configurators
    ) external {
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < configurators.length; i++) {
            VaultConfigurator configurator = configurators[i];
            IDefaultAccessControl(configurator.vault()).requireAdmin(msg.sender);
            configurator.rollbackStagedBaseDelay();
            configurator.rollbackStagedMaximalTotalSupplyDelay();
            configurator.rollbackStagedMaximalTotalSupply();
        }
    }
```
