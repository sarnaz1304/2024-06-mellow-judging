# Depositing can be locked immediately by an operator at any time he/she want.

## Summary
There is `revokeDepositsLock` function for `_isDepositLocked` parameter of `VaultConfigurator`, 
Unlike `rollbackStagedDepositsLock` function, it doesn't clear staged status of `_isDepositLocked`.
This vulnerability can be abused to lock depositing without delay time by an operator.

## Vulnerability Detail
There is `revokeDepositsLock` function for `_isDepositLocked` parameter of `VaultConfigurator`.
It set `_isDepositLocked` as `0`, but it does not clear staged status unlike `rollbackStagedDepositsLock` function.
```solidity
File: VaultConfigurator.sol
180:function revokeDepositsLock() external atLeastOperator nonReentrant {
181:    _isDepositLocked.value = 0;
182:}
```
This vulnerability can be abused to lock depositing without delay time by an operator.

Scenario:
1. Suppose that depositing is locked now and `_isDepositLockedDelay` is `1 hours`.
2. An operator stage `_isDepositLocked` to be `1` on purpose. Since the current value of `_isDepositLocked` is `1`, it has no effect but it is staged without error. And that's why other operators and administrator ignore the very `Stage` event.
3. After `1 hours`, someone unlock depositing by `revokeDepositsLock` function. However the staging of `_isDepositLocked` never be cleared there.
4. Now the operator can lock depositing immediately by only calling `commitDepositsLock` function at any time he/she want.

Note:
1. The protocol users think that operators could not lock depositing within `1 hours` after unlocking without knowing that unlocking is already staged a long time ago.
2. The locking is staged when it is in the locked status, but it is commited when it is in the unlocked status in the above scenario.

## Impact
Depositing can be locked immediately by an operator without delay time.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add rollback of staging to the `revokeDepositsLock` function.
```solidity
File: VaultConfigurator.sol
180:function revokeDepositsLock() external atLeastOperator nonReentrant {
181:    _isDepositLocked.value = 0;
+       delete _isDepositLocked.stagedValue;
+       delete _isDepositLocked.stageTimestamp;
182:}
```
