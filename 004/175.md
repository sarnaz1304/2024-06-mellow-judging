# Oracle can still return an invalid price because the fix from the previous audit is wrong

## Summary

Oracle can still return an invalid price because the recommendation from the previous audit was wrong

When the oracle fails to return a price (`signedAnswer`), it returns 0, but there is no such check.

## Vulnerability Detail

The protocol uses the `_validateAndGetPrice()` function to get and validate a price from the Chainlink oracle:

```solidity
    function _validateAndGetPrice(
        AggregatorData memory data
    ) private view returns (uint256 answer, uint8 decimals) {
        if (data.aggregatorV3 == address(0)) revert AddressZero();
        (, int256 signedAnswer, , uint256 lastTimestamp, ) = IAggregatorV3(
            data.aggregatorV3
        ).latestRoundData();
        // The roundId and latestRound are not used in the validation process to ensure compatibility
        // with various custom aggregator implementations that may handle these parameters differently
        if (signedAnswer < 0) revert InvalidOracleData();
        answer = uint256(signedAnswer);
        if (block.timestamp - data.maxAge > lastTimestamp) revert StaleOracle();
        decimals = IAggregatorV3(data.aggregatorV3).decimals();
    }
```

We can see from the previous audit that the protocol made the necessary checks for the oracle to return a correct price. 
But there is an inaccurate check that causes the Oracle to return a token price of zero.

According to Chainlink's documentation, `latestRoundData()` function does not error if no answer has been reached but returns 0.

This means that if for some reason the oracle fails to take a price, it will return `signedAnswer = 0`. 
But we can see both from the recommendation in the previous audit and in the code now, that there is only a check about if `signedAnswer` is less than zero.

```solidity
if (signedAnswer < 0) revert InvalidOracleData();
```

This means that the vulnerability is not fixed and the returned price may be wrong.
## Impact

It is possible for the oracle to return a price of zero for a given token and have very negative consequences for the protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

When checking `signedAnswer` you must check that the value is not zero as well:

```solidity
if (signedAnswer <= 0) revert InvalidOracleData();
```
