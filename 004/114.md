# Stale or incorrect results of Chainlink's Oracle may break the functionality of critical functions such as deposit and affect users

## Summary
Chainlink's latestRoundData() is used but there is not sufficient check if the return value indicates stale data. This could lead to stale prices according to the [Chainlink documentation](https://docs.chain.link/docs/historical-price-data/#historical-rounds) and may even break functionality of critical functions in the codebase.


## Vulnerability Detail
In the codebase, Chainlink's [latestRoundData](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-mellow/blob/main/mellow-lrt/src/oracles/ChainlinkOracle.sol#L60) is implemented as follow:
```solidity
  (, int256 signedAnswer, , uint256 lastTimestamp, ) = IAggregatorV3(
            data.aggregatorV3
        ).latestRoundData();
        // The roundId and latestRound are not used in the validation process to ensure compatibility
        // with various custom aggregator implementations that may handle these parameters differently
        if (signedAnswer < 0) revert InvalidOracleData();
```
It can be seen only "signedAnswer" and "lastTimestamp" is taken into account, and even if in the comment section of the specified code it is explained why *roundId and latestRound* are not used, Ä± do not think that is a secure way. Because oracle's price return is used heavily in the codebase. Even critical functions like [deposit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-mellow/blob/main/mellow-lrt/src/Vault.sol#L285) is implemented based  on chainlik's Oracle.
```solidity
  function deposit(
        address to,
        uint256[] memory amounts,
        uint256 minLpAmount,
        uint256 deadline
    )
        external
        nonReentrant
        checkDeadline(deadline) 
        returns (uint256[] memory actualAmounts, uint256 lpAmount)
    {
      ...
   
        uint256 depositValue = 0;
        uint256 totalValue = 0;
        actualAmounts = new uint256[](tokens.length);
        IPriceOracle priceOracle = IPriceOracle(configurator.priceOracle());
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokens.length; i++) {
-->            uint256 priceX96 = priceOracle.priceX96(address(this), tokens[i]);
            //@audit-issue if the oracle's price returns stale, deposit may not work correctly
            totalValue += totalAmounts[i] == 0
                ? 0
                : FullMath.mulDivRoundingUp(totalAmounts[i], priceX96, Q96);
            if (ratiosX96[i] == 0) continue;
            uint256 amount = FullMath.mulDiv(ratioX96, ratiosX96[i], Q96);
            IERC20(tokens[i]).safeTransferFrom(
                msg.sender,
                address(this),
                amount
            );
            actualAmounts[i] = amount;
            depositValue += FullMath.mulDiv(amount, priceX96, Q96);
        }

-->        lpAmount = _processLpAmount(to, depositValue, totalValue, minLpAmount);
 ...
    }
```
From the code above, "priceX96" is the return value of [priceX96](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-mellow/blob/main/mellow-lrt/src/oracles/ChainlinkOracle.sol#L80) function, which is implemented based on the Chainlink's Oracle. If the return price is stale, deposit function and users will be affected accordingly. Users might result in getting incorrect lpAmount. Because it from the code above, it is clearly obvious that *lpAmount, depositValue, totalValue* are all connected to *priceX96* 
## Impact
Stale or incorrect results may break the functionality of critical functions and may prevent  depositors to get incorrect lpAmount.

## Recommendation
Consider adding sufficient checks for stale data and implement a more secure way for various custom aggregator
