# Chainlinkâ€™s latestRoundData might return zero

## Summary
The price feed may return a zero value, which must be handled as invalid. The current implementation does not adequately verify the price returned by the oracle, potentially leading to the acceptance of incorrect pricing.

## Vulnerability Detail
The oracle can return a zero value under certain circumstances, and integrations should handle this case. Issues with Chainlink, such as failing to start a new round or finding consensus on a new value (e.g. Chainlink nodes abandon the oracle, chain congestion, vulnerability/attacks on the Chainlink system), can cause consumers of this contract to use outdated, stale data. If oracles are unable to submit new data, no new round is started, leading to stale prices and incorrect price values.

It is critical that the price of assets cannot be zero due to errors from the oracle. A zero-value check should be consistently implemented, as seen in protocols like  AAVE, and Compound:

AAVE - [Source Code](https://github.com/aave/aave-protocol/blob/4b4545fb583fd4f400507b10f3c3114f45b8a037/contracts/misc/ChainlinkProxyPriceProvider.sol#L78) and [Documentation](https://docs.aave.com/developers/v/1.0/developing-on-aave/the-protocol/price-oracle)
Compound - [Source Code](https://github.com/compound-finance/comet/blob/22cf923b6263177555272dde8b0791703895517d/contracts/pricefeeds/WBTCPriceFeed.sol#L69)

## Impact
If an incorrect zero value is returned from the oracle, affected assets within the protocol may be considered worthless. This can lead to severe issues, especially in the event of a market crash.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Ensure the returned price is not zero. Modify the `_validateAndGetPrice` function to include a check for zero values:

```diff
    function _validateAndGetPrice(
        AggregatorData memory data
    ) private view returns (uint256 answer, uint8 decimals) {
        if (data.aggregatorV3 == address(0)) revert AddressZero();
        (, int256 signedAnswer, , uint256 lastTimestamp, ) = IAggregatorV3(
            data.aggregatorV3
        ).latestRoundData();
        // The roundId and latestRound are not used in the validation process to ensure compatibility
        // with various custom aggregator implementations that may handle these parameters differently
-        if (signedAnswer < 0) revert InvalidOracleData();
+       if (signedAnswer <= 0) revert InvalidOracleData();
        answer = uint256(signedAnswer);
        if (block.timestamp - data.maxAge > lastTimestamp) revert StaleOracle();
        decimals = IAggregatorV3(data.aggregatorV3).decimals();
    }
```
