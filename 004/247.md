# Chainlink 0 answer not handled

## Summary
`ChainlinkOracle.sol: _validateAndGetPrice()` calls `latestRoundData()` to get the price. While it does revert if the price is negative it does not handle the return of 0 answer

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
        (, int256 signedAnswer, , uint256 lastTimestamp, ) = IAggregatorV3(
            data.aggregatorV3
        ).latestRoundData();
...
        if (signedAnswer < 0) revert InvalidOracleData();
```
As you can see we only check if the returned price (`signedAnswer`) is less than 0 but we don't check if it is equal to 0.

## Impact
This means that if the oracle returns 0 price the transaction will not revert and the protocol will use this 0 price for calculations. This may lead to loss of funds.

            data.aggregatorV3
        ).latestRoundData();
...
-       if (signedAnswer < 0) revert InvalidOracleData();
+       if (signedAnswer <= 0) revert InvalidOracleData();
```
