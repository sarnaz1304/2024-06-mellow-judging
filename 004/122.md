# `ChainlinkOracle::_validateAndGetPrice` should revert for `answer <= 0` rather than `answer < 0`

## Summary
`ChainlinkOracle::_validateAndGetPrice` should revert for `answer <= 0` rather than `answer < 0`

## Vulnerability Detail
The `_validateAndGetPrice` function is used to sanitize the latestRoundData return values and ensure everything works correctly.
The issue is that the case `answer == 0` has been forgotten, as it would revert only for `answer < 0` while it should be `answer <= 0`

```solidity
File: src/oracles/ChainlinkOracle.sol
56:     function _validateAndGetPrice(
57:         AggregatorData memory data
58:     ) private view returns (uint256 answer, uint8 decimals) {
59:         if (data.aggregatorV3 == address(0)) revert AddressZero();
60:         (, int256 signedAnswer, , uint256 lastTimestamp, ) = IAggregatorV3(
61:             data.aggregatorV3
62:         ).latestRoundData();
63:         // The roundId and latestRound are not used in the validation process to ensure compatibility
64:         // with various custom aggregator implementations that may handle these parameters differently
65:❌		if (signedAnswer < 0) revert InvalidOracleData();
66:         answer = uint256(signedAnswer);
67:         if (block.timestamp - data.maxAge > lastTimestamp) revert StaleOracle();
68:         decimals = IAggregatorV3(data.aggregatorV3).decimals();
69:     }
```

## Impact
A returned price of 0, which would indicate an issue from Chainlink Price Feed will be processed as valid, having serious effects further down. For example, during deposits, a user would get its assets transfered to the vault, but no shares would be minted against those assets because of a zero price used to calculate associated shares.
