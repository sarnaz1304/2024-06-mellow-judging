# Incomplete Round Completeness Check

## Summary
The ChainlinkOracle contract doesn't properly check if the oracle round is complete, which could lead to using incomplete or incorrect price data.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `_validateAndGetPrice` function retrieves the latest round data but doesn't check if the round is actually complete. It only checks for stale data based on `maxAge`. This could potentially lead to using incomplete round data.

## Impact
Using incomplete round data could result in incorrect pricing, leading to potential financial losses for users or the protocol.


## Code Snippet
```solidity
function _validateAndGetPrice(
    AggregatorData memory data
) private view returns (uint256 answer, uint8 decimals) {
    // ...
    (, int256 signedAnswer, , uint256 lastTimestamp, ) = IAggregatorV3(
        data.aggregatorV3
    ).latestRoundData();
    // No check for round completeness
    // ...
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a check for round completeness. This typically involves checking the answeredInRound parameter returned by latestRoundData():
```solidity
(uint80 roundId, int256 signedAnswer, , uint256 lastTimestamp, uint80 answeredInRound) = IAggregatorV3(
    data.aggregatorV3
).latestRoundData();
require(answeredInRound >= roundId, "Round not complete");
```
