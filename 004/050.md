# Incorect oracle price validation could lead to user loses

## Summary
The protocol lets user deposit funds and mints lp tokens in return based on the current oracle price of the token deposited. However the price of the token is not correctly validated which could lead to a user receiving less lp tokens. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The protocol lets users deposit funds in different ratios.

First the ratios are calculated
```javascript
        uint128[] memory ratiosX96 = IRatiosOracle(configurator.ratiosOracle())
            .getTargetRatiosX96(address(this), true);

        uint256 ratioX96 = type(uint256).max;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokens.length; i++) {
            if (ratiosX96[i] == 0) continue;
            uint256 ratioX96_ = FullMath.mulDiv(amounts[i], Q96, ratiosX96[i]);
            if (ratioX96_ < ratioX96) ratioX96 = ratioX96_;
        }
        if (ratioX96 == 0) revert ValueZero();
```
Here note than `configurator.ratiosOracle()` is not a chainlink oracle, but is updated a trusted admin, so it is, not the same as the chainlink oracle.

Next the ratios of the tokens are calculated according to the asset price
```javascript
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokens.length; i++) {
=>          uint256 priceX96 = priceOracle.priceX96(address(this), tokens[i]);
            totalValue += totalAmounts[i] == 0
                ? 0
                : FullMath.mulDivRoundingUp(totalAmounts[i], priceX96, Q96);
            if (ratiosX96[i] == 0) continue;
            uint256 amount = FullMath.mulDiv(ratioX96, ratiosX96[i], Q96);
            IERC20(tokens[i]).safeTransferFrom(
                msg.sender,
                address(this),
                amount
            );
            actualAmounts[i] = amount;
=>          depositValue += FullMath.mulDiv(amount, priceX96, Q96);
        }

```
The `depositValue` is the amount of lp tokens that the user would be minted.
There is a minLpAmount passed in by the user - however this may not be enough due ti fact that the ratio is determined by the price and the price can change before the user transaction is executed.

Going back to the precious code snippet when `priceOracle.priceX96(address(this), tokens[i]);`, going down the call stack we can see that the price of the oracle is retrieved from chainlink aggregator. The validation verifies the returned price is positive, however it does not verify that the price is not equal to 0. 
```javascript
        (, int256 signedAnswer, , uint256 lastTimestamp, ) = IAggregatorV3(data.aggregatorV3).latestRoundData(); // ok
        // The roundId and latestRound are not used in the validation process to ensure compatibility
        // with various custom aggregator implementations that may handle these parameters differently
=>      if (signedAnswer < 0) revert InvalidOracleData();  
```

The signedAnswer fetches the asset price from a Chainlink aggregator using the latestRoundData function. However, there is no check if the price is NOT zero.

According to Chainlink's documentation, this function does not error if no answer has been reached but returns 0, causing an incorrect price feed.

If the returned answer by the oracle is 0 going back the call stack the LP amount for the token would be 0 and the user funds would be transferred to the contract. The user would NOT receive LP tokens for all of his deposited tokens. 

## Impact
Loss of user funds

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Revert if returned price is 0
```diff
    function _validateAndGetPrice(
        AggregatorData memory data
    ) private view returns (uint256 answer, uint8 decimals) {
        if (data.aggregatorV3 == address(0)) revert AddressZero();
        (, int256 signedAnswer, , uint256 lastTimestamp, ) = IAggregatorV3(
               data.aggregatorV3
               ).latestRoundData();
        // The roundId and latestRound are not used in the validation process to ensure compatibility
        // with various custom aggregator implementations that may handle these parameters differently
-       if (signedAnswer < 0) revert InvalidOracleData(); 
+       if (signedAnswer <= 0) revert InvalidOracleData(); 
        answer = uint256(signedAnswer);
        if (block.timestamp - data.maxAge > lastTimestamp) revert StaleOracle();
        decimals = IAggregatorV3(data.aggregatorV3).decimals();
    }
```
