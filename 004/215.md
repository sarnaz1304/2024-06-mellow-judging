# ChainlinkOracle doesn’t validate min/max answer and will return incorrect price during flash crashes

## Summary

Not validating the price against min/max values of the Chainlink Aggregators will fail to revert the transaction during price crashes and will open arbitrage opportunities in the Mellow Vaults.

## Vulnerability Detail

From the deployment scripts we can observe the following Chainlink addresses will be used in the upcoming mainnet deployment:

- `stETH/ETH` - https://etherscan.io/address/0x716BB759A5f6faCdfF91F0AfB613133d510e1573#readContract
- `rETH/ETH` - https://etherscan.io/address/0x9cB248E68fb81d0CFE7D6B3265Fe6Bf123A71FE0#readContract

Both of these contracts are Chainlink aggregators and have minAnswer and maxAnswer functions, that are used to indicate and validate the price returned from `latestRoundData` and revert the transaction if the range doesn’t hold. The problem is that Mellow does not utilize these functions and will end up using extremely wrong prices in case there is a short crash of the price as [[Venus on BSC when LUNA imploded](https://rekt.news/venus-blizz-rekt/)](https://rekt.news/venus-blizz-rekt/).

```solidity
function _validateAndGetPrice(
    AggregatorData memory data
) private view returns (uint256 answer, uint8 decimals) {
    if (data.aggregatorV3 == address(0)) revert AddressZero();
    (, int256 signedAnswer, , uint256 lastTimestamp, ) = IAggregatorV3(
        data.aggregatorV3
    ).latestRoundData();
    // The roundId and latestRound are not used in the validation process to ensure compatibility
    // with various custom aggregator implementations that may handle these parameters differently
    if (signedAnswer < 0) revert InvalidOracleData();
    answer = uint256(signedAnswer);
    if (block.timestamp - data.maxAge > lastTimestamp) revert StaleOracle();
    decimals = IAggregatorV3(data.aggregatorV3).decimals();
}
```

That will lead to unfair lpToken pricing and users will end up extracting value from the protocol

## Impact

- wrong pricing of the lpToken, since it relies on all the underlying tokens to be converted to their ETH rate through `ChainlinkOracle` and when crash happens it will go unnoticed.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add min and max answer checks to `ChainlinkOracle`, as well as in the custom Aggregators add uint256 max and 1 answers.
