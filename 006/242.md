# Calls to `delegateCall` function do not check `delegateCall`'s `success` and `response`, which breaks contract invariants if `delegateCall` returns `false`

## Summary
`delegateCall` function is defined in `src/Vault.sol`.  `delegateCall` returns `success` status and `response`. There are calls to `delegateCall`, which do not check the `success` status and `response` of `delegateCall`, which is problematic.

## Vulnerability Detail
- Function `_processWithdrawals` from `src/strategies/DefaultBondStrategy.sol` calls `delegateCall` function in the following code snippet:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-mellow/blob/main/mellow-lrt/src/strategies/DefaultBondStrategy.sol#L107-L114

However, the `success` of `delegateCall` is not checked.

- Function `_deposit` from `src/strategies/DefaultBondStrategy.sol` calls `delegateCall` function in the following code snippet:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-mellow/blob/main/mellow-lrt/src/strategies/DefaultBondStrategy.sol#L65-L72

However, the `success` of `delegateCall` is not checked.

- Function `processWithdrawals` from `src/strategies/SimpleDVTStakingStrategy.sol` calls `delegateCall` function in the following code snippet:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-mellow/blob/main/mellow-lrt/src/strategies/SimpleDVTStakingStrategy.sol#L72-L78

However, the `success` of `delegateCall` is not checked.

Missing the `success` check of `delegateCall` is dangerous as the `delegateCall` may fail silently and the caller of `delegateCall` woudn't consider the failure of `delegateCall` and continue further as if `delegateCall` executed successfully.

## Impact
Not checking the `success` of `delegateCall` is dangerous, because callers of `delegateCall` assume that `delegateCall` executed successfully, which might not be the case. Thus, `delegateCall` fails silently, which may break contract invariants and state.

## Code Snippet
In the following code snippets the calls to `delegateCall` are not checked:

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check the `success` status and `response` of `delegateCall`. Either propagate `success` status and `response` up the call stack or the callers of `delegateCall` should revert if `delegateCall`'s `success` is set to `false`.
