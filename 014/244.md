# Withdrawal fee cannot be claimed and will be stuck in the Vault

## Summary

All the fees ever taken in the form of LST tokens will be stuck in the vault as there is no way to be retrieved by anyone due to a missing function.

## Vulnerability Detail

When withdrawal happens there is a withdrawFee taken, which in normal scenarios is redeposited in the strategies so it continuously increases the lpToken price. The problem is that this fee cannot be withdrawn from anyone and when the last withdrawal happens it will remain locked in the Vault with no way to be retrieved.

Consider the following example:

Vault has a single underlying token, the exchange rate of the lpToken is 1:1, both `totalValue` and `totalSupply` are 100 tokens and `withdrawalFee` is 5% (5e7)

There are 2 users left in the Vault with equally distributed lpToken and both of them have their withdrawal requests executed:

```solidity
function analyzeRequest(
      ProcessWithdrawalsStack memory s,
      WithdrawalRequest memory request
  ) public pure returns (bool, bool, uint256[] memory expectedAmounts) {
      uint256 lpAmount = request.lpAmount;
      if (
          request.tokensHash != s.tokensHash || request.deadline < s.timestamp
      ) return (false, false, expectedAmounts);

      uint256 value = FullMath.mulDiv(lpAmount, s.totalValue, s.totalSupply);
      value = FullMath.mulDiv(value, D9 - s.feeD9, D9);
      uint256 coefficientX96 = FullMath.mulDiv(value, Q96, s.ratiosX96Value); 

      uint256 length = s.erc20Balances.length;
      expectedAmounts = new uint256[](length);
      for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; i++) {
          uint256 ratiosX96 = s.ratiosX96[i];
          expectedAmounts[i] = ratiosX96 == 0
              ? 0
              : FullMath.mulDiv(coefficientX96, ratiosX96, Q96); // (394140184405850747 * (2^96 / 2)) / 2^96
          if (expectedAmounts[i] >= request.minAmounts[i]) continue;
          return (false, false, expectedAmounts);
      }
      for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; i++) {
          if (s.erc20Balances[i] >= expectedAmounts[i]) continue;
          return (true, false, expectedAmounts);
      }
      return (true, true, expectedAmounts);
  }
```
Important to note that all the values will be equal since  `Vault::calculateStack` is called only at the beginning of the `processWithdrawals` and values for both users will be the same.

First user `analyzeRequest`:

1. Value = (50 / 100) * 100 = 50
2. Value with fee taken = 50 - 5% = 47.5
3. coefficientX96 = 47.5 * ~~2^96~~ / ~~2^96~~ (can fluctuate a bit depending on the underlying token price in terms of ETH, we assume 1:1 as well, for simplicity and the fact this has no effect on the funds left in the end)
4. expectedAmount = 47.5 (tokens transferred to the user)

Second user `analyzeRequest`:

1. Value = (50 / 100) * 100 = 50
2. Value with fee taken = 50 - 5% = 47.5
3. coefficientX96 = 47.5 * ~~2^96~~ / ~~2^96~~ (can fluctuate a bit depending on the underlying token price in terms of ETH, we assume 1:1 as well, for simplicity and the fact this has no effect on the funds left in the end)
4. expectedAmount = 47.5 (tokens transferred to the user)

After the withdrawals, state of the Vault looks like this:

- `totalValue` = 100 - (47.5 * 2) = 5 tokens
- `totalSupply` = 50 = 0

In conclusion there will be at least 5 tokens left for this configuration as the amount will increase when the amount of withdrawal requests processed also increases.

## Impact

- After last withdrawals fees accumulated will be locked in the Vault without a way to be retrieved

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a function to claim the excess withdrawal fees.
