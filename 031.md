# Operators are not paid for executing TXs

## Summary
Operators are not paid for executing transactions, which discourages them from performing these tasks and strains the system.

## Vulnerability Detail
Operators execute [processAll](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-mellow/blob/main/mellow-lrt/src/strategies/DefaultBondStrategy.sol#L84) and [processWithdrawals](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-mellow/blob/main/mellow-lrt/src/strategies/DefaultBondStrategy.sol#L90), which can be quite gas-intensive. Both functions involve multiple loops, and since the system will run on the ETH mainnet, gas fees can be big.

In the current case there are no fees paid to the operators/admins who execute the functions, leading to two possible outcomes:
1. Functions will not be called, as they don't yield profit - if operators are 3rd party entities.
2. The system will incur losses - if operators are a part of the system.

## Impact
Either the withdrawal functions will be rarely executed, or they will incur cost to the system.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function processAll() external {
    _requireAtLeastOperator();
    _processWithdrawals(vault.pendingWithdrawers());
}

function processWithdrawals(address[] memory users) external {
    if (users.length == 0) return;
    _requireAtLeastOperator();
    _processWithdrawals(users);
}
```
## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a small fee to pay operators if they are third-party executors. Alternatively, if operators are part of the system, increase the withdrawal `fee9` or ensure it is not zero (as in the current deploy scripts).
