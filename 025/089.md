# Users can game the vault with LST slashings

## Summary
Users can exploit the vault using LST slashing.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `deposit` function deposits fixed percentages of each asset but mints LP tokens based on the relative price of that asset, with prices sourced from Chainlink.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-mellow/blob/main/mellow-lrt/src/Vault.sol#L323-L326
```solidity
  uint256 priceX96 = priceOracle.priceX96(address(this), tokens[i]);
  totalValue += totalAmounts[i] == 0 ? 0 : FullMath.mulDivRoundingUp(totalAmounts[i], priceX96, Q96);
```
The problem with LSTs is they can be slashed, decreasing their value. Users can exploit this decrease to mint more vault LP tokens.

When a price change occurs, such as slashing or Chainlink divergence ([rETH has 2%](https://data.chain.link/feeds/ethereum/mainnet/reth-eth)), a user can deposit the asset into the vault just before the price update. Since the deposit occurs before the price update, the user deposits the asset at the higher old price, resulting in more LP tokens being minted.

The impact can be increased by the fact that deposits and withdrawals can have different ratios, which often occurs when a vault transitions from one ratio to another (e.g., moving from `WETH 50:50 wstETH` to `WETH 20:80 wstETH`).

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-mellow/blob/main/mellow-lrt/src/oracles/ManagedRatiosOracle.sol#L40

```solidity
    function getTargetRatiosX96(address vault, bool isDeposit) external view override returns (uint128[] memory) {
        // note how we can have one ratio for deposits and another for withdrawals
        bytes memory data_ = vaultToData[vault][isDeposit];
        ...
```

Example scenario:
| *Prerequisites*            | *Values*                      |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| deposit USDC : rETH        | 0% : 100%                     |
| withdraw USDC : rETH       | 100% : 0%                     |
| Vault balances USDC : rETH | 3.2m : 100                    |
| Vault LP                   | 900 (LP value == WETH value) |
| Vault value                | 3.6m                            |
| Base token                 | WETH                          |
| WETH price                 | 4000 USD                      |
| rETH price                 | 4000 USD                      |
| USDC price                 | 1 USD                         |

- The vault is moving from `USDC 100:0 rETH` to `USDC 0:100 rETH`, so deposits are set to `USDC 0:100 rETH` and withdrawals to `USDC 100:0 rETH` until the vault reaches the new ratio.
 
1. `rETH` is slashed by 2%.
2. User1 sees the slash and front-runs the Chainlink price update with a deposit of 100 `rETH`.
3. User1 has 100 LP tokens valued at 400k USD (LP value == base token value).
4. Price update occurs, and the value of rETH declines to 3920 USD.
5. The vault value declines by `200 * (4000 - 3920) = 16000`. 
6. LP tokens are worth `4m - 16k / 1000 = 3984`
7. User1 still withdraws their LP tokens for 398.4k USDC, even thought they should be worth 392k USD.

Note that the vault doesn't need to move balance for this to work, different ratios for deposit/withdraw only magnifies the attack. Also, the vault doesn't need to move 100% in one direction or the other, smaller moves will also increase the funds that can be exploited.

## Impact
Users can exploit price updates, such as slashing or maximum Chainlink divergence.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
            uint256 priceX96 = priceOracle.priceX96(address(this), tokens[i]);
            totalValue += totalAmounts[i] == 0
                ? 0
                : FullMath.mulDivRoundingUp(totalAmounts[i], priceX96, Q96);
```

## Recommendation
Given the complexity of the attack, it cannot be fixed with simple code changes, as it stems from using price instead of ratio to make deposits. Minting LP based on
