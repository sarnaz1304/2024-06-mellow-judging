# When depositing, there is no slippage protection for transferred amounts.

## Summary

When depositing, there is no slippage protection for transferred amounts.

## Vulnerability Detail

Function deposit is used to deposit some tokens and obtain corresponding LP tokens. In the implementation, contract will check the minLpAmount to protect user from slippage about LP tokens. However, the amouts of userâ€™s transferred tokens (or deposited tokens) should also be protected from slippage. Overwise, user may deposit too many tokens, which is undesirable. 

## Impact

User may deposit too many tokens
