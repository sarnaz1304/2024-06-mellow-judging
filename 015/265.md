# DOS on Obol deposits due to frontrunning

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
For obol staking associated vaults, the `weth` in the Vault is supposed to be allocated to the obol validators by invoking the `convertAndDeposit` function

```solidity
    function convertAndDeposit(
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 blockNumber,
        bytes32 blockHash,
        bytes32 depositRoot,
        uint256 nonce,
        bytes calldata depositCalldata,
        IDepositSecurityModule.Signature[] calldata sortedGuardianSignatures
    ) external returns (bool success) {
```

Since any user can permissionlessly invoke the `depositBufferedEther` function of Lido given they have these params, a user can front run this call and invoke the `depositBufferedEther` function directly. This will cause the deposit to occur without the assets in the vault being allocated and the second call to revert since the depositRoot would change due to the new deposit.
