# DOS due to expected amount during deposits/withdrawls being lowered due to withdrawals

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
The `convertAndDeposit` and `convert` functions passes the amount to convert as a param. This `amount` of weth is supposed to be <= balance of the vault.

```solidity
    function convertAndDeposit(
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 blockNumber,
        bytes32 blockHash,
        bytes32 depositRoot,
        uint256 nonce,
        bytes calldata depositCalldata,
        IDepositSecurityModule.Signature[] calldata sortedGuardianSignatures
    ) external onlyDelegateCall {
        if (IERC20(weth).balanceOf(address(this)) < amount)
            revert NotEnoughWeth();

```

But the weth in the contract is movable by user actions like `emergencyWithdrawal`. Hence such a transaction will cause the `convertAndDeposit` and `convert` function calls to revert. This is especially important for `convertAndDeposit` call since it will contain the deposit related params like `guardianSigantures` etc. Such a revert will make these params public even if a private tx is used allowing other user's to manipulate the amount  

## Impact
Possible DOS on staking module deposits and withdrawals, and leakage of information allowing for users to divert the vault funds from obol validators

## Recommendation
In `convertAndDeposit`, compute the amount rather passing the predefined amount and limit the amount to vault's balance incase of `convert`
