# Predefined amount parameter can challange allocation to Obol validators

## Summary
Deposits need not be allocated to Obol validators

## Vulnerability Detail
In `StakingModule`, the amount to be deposited in Lido is supposed to go to the Obol validators. But the only check kept for this is that the `stakingModuleId` is set to `SimpleDVT` module id in Lido and `unfinalizedstETH <= bufferedETH`

```solidity
    function convertAndDeposit(
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 blockNumber,
        bytes32 blockHash,
        bytes32 depositRoot,
        uint256 nonce,
        bytes calldata depositCalldata,
        IDepositSecurityModule.Signature[] calldata sortedGuardianSignatures
    ) external onlyDelegateCall {
        if (IERC20(weth).balanceOf(address(this)) < amount)
            revert NotEnoughWeth();


        uint256 unfinalizedStETH = withdrawalQueue.unfinalizedStETH();
        uint256 bufferedEther = ISteth(steth).getBufferedEther();
        if (bufferedEther < unfinalizedStETH)
            revert InvalidWithdrawalQueueState();


        _wethToWSteth(amount);
        depositSecurityModule.depositBufferedEther(
            blockNumber,
            blockHash,
            depositRoot,
            stakingModuleId,
            nonce,
            depositCalldata,
            sortedGuardianSignatures
        );
    }
```

There is no enforcement/checks kept on the `amount` param. It is possible to pass in any value for the `amount` param or the buffered ETH amount in lido to change from the value using which the amount was calculated before the call due to other deposits . This allows for scenarios where the `amount` is not deposited into validators at all (not in multiples of 32 eth), could be shared with other staking modules or could result in reverts due to the max limit restriction in the lido side. There is also no enforcement that the deposits made would be allocated to Obol validators itself since the simpleDVT staking module in Lido also contains SSV operators

## Impact
The amount to be staked for obol validators can be assigned to other operators

## Code Snippet

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consult with lido team to make it possible to deposit specifically to a certain set of operators and calculate the maximum amount depositable to that set at the instant of the call rather than a predefined value
