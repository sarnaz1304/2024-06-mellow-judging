# Protocol inflates the amount of tokens received when depositing for some tokens


## Summary

Protocol inflates the amount of tokens received when depositing for some tokens

## Vulnerability Detail

The readMe hints that the supported tokens are steth, weth & wsteth.

Now when depositing there is an instance where the amount of lp to process for the deposit is being processed, and in this instance, there is a need to route through all the tokens that are to be deposited and then calculate the `depositValue` which ends up being used to process the lp amounts, see https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-mellow/blob/26aa0445ec405a4ad637bddeeedec4efe1eba8d2/mellow-lrt/src/Vault.sol#L322-L338

```solidity
    function deposit() {
..
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokens.length; i++) {
            uint256 priceX96 = priceOracle.priceX96(address(this), tokens[i]);
            totalValue += totalAmounts[i] == 0
                ? 0
                : FullMath.mulDivRoundingUp(totalAmounts[i], priceX96, Q96);
            if (ratiosX96[i] == 0) continue;
            uint256 amount = FullMath.mulDiv(ratioX96, ratiosX96[i], Q96);
            IERC20(tokens[i]).safeTransferFrom(
                msg.sender,
                address(this),
                amount
            );
            actualAmounts[i] = amount;
            depositValue += FullMath.mulDiv(amount, priceX96, Q96);
        }

        lpAmount = _processLpAmount(to, depositValue, totalValue, minLpAmount);
..
        }
```

Would be key to note that `stETH` is **not** a fee on transfer token, however it is a special token when it comes to it's transfer logic, navigating to lido's official docs we can see that there is a special section that talks about it's unique concept, i.e the "1-2 wei corner case", see https://docs.lido.fi/guides/lido-tokens-integration-guide/#1-2-wei-corner-case, quoting them:

> stETH balance calculation includes integer division, and there is a common case when the whole stETH balance can't be transferred from the account while leaving the last 1-2 wei on the sender's account. The same thing can actually happen at any transfer or deposit transaction. In the future, when the stETH/share rate will be greater, the error can become a bit bigger. To avoid it, one can use `transferShares` to be precise.

> More can be read on the "1-2 wei corner case" issue from [here](https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-dao/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+rounding+down).

What this means in the context of Mellow is that, since in all deposits of the steth token the amount really transferred is being inflated, so we are to also expect an inflation in the amount of lpAmount that gets attached to this, with consequents deposits through the lifetime of the protocol, the disparity between the real amount of lp, and the value that's backing them is only going to get higher, would be key to note that even Lido has hinted that this round down could be larger in the future.

## Impact

Accounting flaw in regards to the real deposited value, which not only means an inflation of the lpAmounts being processed, but also the fact that in the case of a bank run the last set of users might not be able to withdraw their assets considering with time the disparity between value deposited and lpAmount processed is only going to get accumulatively larger.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Since steth is supported, check the real amount of assets received when a transfer on this token is being processed.
