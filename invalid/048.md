# initial deposit allows front running which can lead to various types of attacks

## Summary
The _processLpAmount function is vulnerable to front-running during the initial deposit. This allows malicious users to manipulate the LP token price ratio by setting it at an inappropriate level.
## Vulnerability Detail
The initial deposit, which determines the LP token price ratio ``(lpPrice = underlyingTvl / totalSupply)``, can be front-run by malicious users because the current implementation does not restrict or properly handle the initial deposit within the constructor. As a result, a malicious user can make a minimal deposit before the designated operator or deployer, setting an unfavorable LP price ratio. This can lead to manipulation of the LP token distribution.
```solidity
function _processLpAmount(
    address to,
    uint256 depositValue,
    uint256 totalValue,
    uint256 minLpAmount
) private returns (uint256 lpAmount) {
    uint256 totalSupply = totalSupply();
    if (totalSupply == 0) {
        // Initial deposit
        _requireAtLeastOperator(); // Only the operator can make the initial deposit
        lpAmount = minLpAmount;
        if (lpAmount == 0) revert ValueZero();
        if (to != address(this)) revert Forbidden();
    } else {
        // Subsequent deposits
        lpAmount = FullMath.mulDiv(depositValue, totalSupply, totalValue);
        if (lpAmount < minLpAmount) revert InsufficientLpAmount();
        if (to == address(0)) revert AddressZero();
    }

    if (lpAmount + totalSupply > configurator.maximalTotalSupply()) {
        revert LimitOverflow();
    }
    _mint(to, lpAmount); // Mint LP tokens
}
```
## Impact
this can cause attacker to receive unfair advantage and causes loss of innocent user
