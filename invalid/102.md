# Single Oracle Dependency

## Summary
The ChainlinkOracle contract relies on a single Chainlink oracle per token, creating a single point of failure.


## Vulnerability Detail
For each token, the contract uses only one Chainlink aggregator. If this oracle fails, is compromised, or reports incorrect data, there's no fallback mechanism or way to cross-check the data.

## Impact
If the single oracle for a token fails or reports incorrect data, it could lead to incorrect pricing in the protocol, potentially causing significant financial losses.


## Code Snippet
```solidity
mapping(address => mapping(address => AggregatorData))
    private _aggregatorsData;

function getPrice(
    address vault,
    address token
) public view returns (uint256 answer, uint8 decimals) {
    return _validateAndGetPrice(_aggregatorsData[vault][token]);
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a system that uses multiple oracles for each token and aggregates their results. This could involve:

- Using a median of multiple oracle prices.
- Implementing a primary/secondary oracle system.
- Using a decentralized oracle network that already aggregates multiple data sources.
