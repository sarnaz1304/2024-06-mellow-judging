# Lack of Circuit Breaker Mechanism

## Summary
The ChainlinkOracle contract does not implement a circuit breaker mechanism to pause operations in case of detected anomalies or emergencies.


## Vulnerability Detail
There's no way to quickly pause the oracle's operations if a problem is detected. This could be particularly problematic if there's a sudden market crash, oracle malfunction, or other emergency situations.

## Impact
In case of extreme market conditions or oracle malfunctions, the lack of a circuit breaker could lead to the protocol operating on incorrect data, potentially causing financial losses.


## Code Snippet
The entire contract lacks a pause mechanism.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a circuit breaker mechanism that allows authorized addresses to pause the oracle's operations:

```solidity
bool public paused;
address public guardian;

modifier notPaused() {
    require(!paused, "Contract is paused");
    _;
}

function pause() external {
    require(msg.sender == guardian, "Only guardian can pause");
    paused = true;
}

function unpause() external {
    require(msg.sender == guardian, "Only guardian can unpause");
    paused = false;
}

// Add notPaused modifier to critical functions
function priceX96(address vault, address token) external view notPaused returns (uint256 priceX96_) {
    // ...
}
```
