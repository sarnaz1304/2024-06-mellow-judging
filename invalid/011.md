# Current deposit/withdrawal logic allows for MEV exploits by tech savvy users since no time duration between the two


## Summary

A user can immediately deposit and then place a withdrawal request which allows them to game the system and make profits when the opportunity arises.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `vault.sol` contract includes functionality for depositing & withdrawing, however after depositign there is no little duration before a user can place a withdrawal request, which then means that users can game the system by taking the simple route below:

- See an update on-chain that's going to increase the worth of the lpAMount by quite a margin.
- Front run this update to deposit so they get minted lpAmounts for cheap.
- Back run the update by then placing a withdrawal request, essentially making profits by no risks since they can even end up claiming their request via [emergencyWithdraw()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-mellow/blob/26aa0445ec405a4ad637bddeeedec4efe1eba8d2/mellow-lrt/src/Vault.sol#L371) after the deadline has passed.

> NB: "Update" here could be anything that would increase the worth of already processed lps, be it oracle updates of the assets they are to deposit becoming very low or what not which a tech savvy user can easily front run to game the system, i.e using rough math cases, assume there is an update that steth price is to drop from `$1000` to `$500` and this price update just got on-chain, the attacker would front run the update via depositing, which would end up having the lpAmount being inflatesd since this is how it's calculated https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-mellow/blob/26aa0445ec405a4ad637bddeeedec4efe1eba8d2/mellow-lrt/src/Vault.sol#L360

```solidity
            lpAmount = FullMath.mulDiv(depositValue, totalSupply, totalValue);

```

> In this case we can't expect the magnitude of inflation of both `depositValue` & `totalValue` to be the same, cause the former in this case would only include the `steth` tokens whereas the latter includes other tokens that have not encountered this massive update.

A similar idea is the fact that since [emergencyWithdraw()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-mellow/blob/26aa0445ec405a4ad637bddeeedec4efe1eba8d2/mellow-lrt/src/Vault.sol#L371) just sends all the current tokens in the vault and not the one specifically deposited by the user, a user can notice the rise of another supported asset price wise, deposit their own not-so pricey asset and request a withdrawal that would end up having them receive this other token, allowing them a risk free trade off to get more `$` for their assets, placing the cost on other honest users.

Similar idea is popularly applicable to slashing where a user would just front these updates placing themselves to make the most out of it while passing the cost to other honest users.

## Impact

As hinted in the _Vulnerability Detail_ section, a user can easily position themselves to make the most out of any update that could affect the current tvl of protocol or the pricing of the supported assets.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider introducing a short time frame between when users can deposit and withdraw, to ensure direct front runs are no longer possible.

Additionally since withdrawals are already broken into two steps, consider checking the worth of the `lpAmounts`, while placing the withdrawals and also while finalizing them via [emergencyWithdraw()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-mellow/blob/26aa0445ec405a4ad637bddeeedec4efe1eba8d2/mellow-lrt/src/Vault.sol#L371) or [processWithdrawals()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-mellow/blob/26aa0445ec405a4ad637bddeeedec4efe1eba8d2/mellow-lrt/src/Vault.sol#L536), the pick the rate that is most favorable to the protocol, i.e in the case the worth of the Lps have drastically reduced during the final step of the withdrawal, send users their tokens using the current rate, and if the rate increases send them with the previous rate. so heavily document this so users understand this helps block all MEV attacks since the best rate one can receive is the one they had when placing the trade.
