# Many cases `stEth.transferFrom` will transfer 1-2 less way, which would result in revert in consequent functions, because of not enough balance


## Summary
This issue is about 1 or 2 wei less transferred on `steth.safeTransferfrom`.

Also, there is another issue on `steth.submit` and `wsteth.wrap` which has a different impact and root cause than this.  
This issue's root cause and fix are on `steth.transferFrom` and balance before/after checks.

2. https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-dao/issues/442

## Vulnerability Detail
The issue occurs in 2 functions with different impacts.

1. Issue on `DepositWrapper.deposit`, when converting from stETH to wstETH in L64-L65 below, if 1 eth is `transferFrom` called, it will pull 1eth - 1 or 2 wei less. And when the code block goes into `_stethToWsteth` which further calls wstETH.wrap which will revert due to less amount. That is, calling wrap(1 steth) but we have 1 steth - 1wei, so it reverts when wrapping. Look at https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-dao/blob/5fcedc6e9a9f3ec154e69cff47c2b9e25503a78a/contracts/0.6.12/WstETH.sol#L57

2. The second issue on `Vault.deposit()`, which calls `stETH.transferfrom`, which pulls 1 or 2 wei less amount which will deflate the share value on every deposit and messes the accounting. The current `depositcallback` doesn't care about the `actualAmounts` array which holds the 1 steth values instead of 1steth - 1 wei actual value. If deposit callbacks does any accounting on this  `actualAmounts`, then the impact will increase.

366:                 address(this),
367:                 amount
368:             );
371:         }
```

## Impact
Reverts on `DepositWrapper.deposit`. so DOS most times. Also wrong accounting on `Vault.deposit()` messing the share value, i.e, mints 1 mellowToken for 1 wsteth - 2 wei deposit.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use lido recommendation to utilize transferShares function, so the amount is realistic, or implement Fee on transfer approach, which compares the balance before and after the transfer.
