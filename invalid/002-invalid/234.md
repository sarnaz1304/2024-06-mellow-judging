# Unable to use stETH directly in DepositWrapper contract do to the Lido 1-2 wei corner case

## Summary

There are many cases when 1-2 wei is left behind when transferring stETH via the safeTransferFrom() function. This can be checked [here](https://docs.lido.fi/guides/lido-tokens-integration-guide/#1-2-wei-corner-case).

## Vulnerability Detail

When users call the deposit() function with the amount parameter, that amount is passed down in the call chain, and the actual amount of stETH transferred from the user is not rechecked.

## Impact

The deposit() function will not work correctly with the stETH token directly.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Similar to fee-on-transfer tokens, in the case of the stETH token, compare the amount value with the balanceBefore and balanceAfter of stETH done after the safeTransferFrom() call.
