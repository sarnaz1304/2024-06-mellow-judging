# Staking module function `_wethToWSteth` assumes a `~1=1` peg of stETH to ETH

## Summary
Assumption that stETH pegged to ETH with ~1=1 could lead to loss of ETH.

## Vulnerability Detail
Vulnerable code link - https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-mellow/blob/main/mellow-lrt/src/utils/DepositWrapper.sol#L42-L75

The deposit function allows users to deposit various tokens, including ETH, WETH, stETH, and wstETH, into a vault. However, the function assumes that stETH is always pegged 1:1 to ETH. This assumption is flawed as the price of stETH can fluctuate. If stETH is worth less than ETH (e.g., 0.92 stETH for 1 ETH), this could result in financial losses for users.

However, the price of stETH can fluctuate based on various factors, including staking rewards and market conditions. For instance, if the price of stETH drops to 0.92 ETH, submitting 1 ETH will result in receiving only 0.92 stETH. The code does not account for this scenario, which can cause miscalculations and potentially lead to financial discrepancies.
Here's an example when that already happened - https://medium.a41.io/dynamic-peg-1-overview-of-the-steth-crisis-causes-and-impacts-4b171f2cf4da.
## Impact
In the scenario where stETH becomes cheaper than ETH, it would lead to a financial loss because we are swapping our 1 ETH for an amount of stETH that is worth less than 1 ETH (for example, 0.92 stETH).

Example: stETH dropped in price to 0.9 ETH. Therefore, if a user deposits ETH/WETH instead of stETH/wstETH, they will make a deposit with the same value, but for more expensive price. This is because the code assumes that 1 ETH is equal to 1 stETH and will count it as the same amount of liquidity provided. Consequently, it is more profitable to provide one asset (stETH/wstETH) instead of another (ETH/WETH)
## Code Snippet
```solidity
function deposit(
    address to,
    address token,
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 minLpAmount,
    uint256 deadline,
    uint256 referralCode
) external payable returns (uint256 lpAmount) {
    address wrapper = address(this);
    address sender = msg.sender;
    address[] memory tokens = vault.underlyingTokens();
    if (tokens.length != 1 || tokens[0] != wsteth)
        revert InvalidTokenList();
    if (amount == 0) revert InvalidAmount();
    if (token == steth) {
        IERC20(steth).safeTransferFrom(sender, wrapper, amount);
        amount = _stethToWsteth(amount);
    } else if (token == weth) {
        IERC20(weth).safeTransferFrom(sender, wrapper, amount);
@>     amount = _wethToWsteth(amount);
    } else if (token == address(0)) {
        if (msg.value != amount) revert InvalidAmount();
@>        amount = _ethToWsteth(amount);
    } else if (wsteth == token) {
        IERC20(wsteth).safeTransferFrom(sender, wrapper, amount);
    } else revert InvalidToken();
    IERC20(wsteth).safeIncreaseAllowance(address(vault), amount);
    uint256[] memory amounts = new uint256[](1);
    amounts[0] = amount;
    (, lpAmount) = vault.deposit(
        to,
        amounts,
        minLpAmount,
        deadline,
        referralCode
    );
}
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation

 Before performing the conversion, check the current price of stETH relative to ETH using Curve pool for example and set `vault.deposit` amount according to fetched ratio.
