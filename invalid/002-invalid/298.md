# Lido 1-2 wei transfer issue

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
When user calls `deposit` and token is `steth`, the `amount` param passed by the user is utilized in `IERC20(steth).safeTransferFrom(sender, wrapper, amount)` and transferred to the contract.

```js
 if (token == steth) {
    IERC20(steth).safeTransferFrom(sender, wrapper, amount); 
    amount = _stethToWsteth(amount);
```

The vulnerability here is that protocol always assumes that the amount of tokens received is equal to the amount of tokens transferred.
This is not the case for rebasing tokens, such as `stETH`, because internally they transfer shares which generally results in the received amount of tokens being lower than the requested one [by a couple of wei](https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-dao/issues/442) because of roundings. This is a known high severity issue.

Wrapping to `wsteth` will revert, because the contract doesn't have enough `stETH`. 
```js
 function _stethToWsteth(uint256 amount) private returns (uint256) {
        IERC20(steth).safeIncreaseAllowance(wsteth, amount);
        IWSteth(wsteth).wrap(amount);steth- reverts
        return IERC20(wsteth).balanceOf(address(this));
    }
```
## Impact
`deposit()`function will revert

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use lido recommendation to utilize transferShares function, so the _amount is realistic, or implement FoT approach, which compares the balance before and after the transfer.
