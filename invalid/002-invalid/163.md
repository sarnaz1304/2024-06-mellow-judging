# Potential 1-2 Wei Loss in Token Transfers Due to Integer Division and Rounding

## Summary
 The deposit function that allows users to deposit tokens into a vault. The function specifically handles Wsteth (wrapped staked Ether) and converts other tokens (stETH, WETH, ETH) to Wsteth if necessary. A potential vulnerability arises from the integer division and rounding down during token transfers, which may result in a 1-2 wei discrepancy. This discrepancy can become significant over time, especially as the stETH/share rate increases.

## Vulnerability Detail
```javascript
  if (token == steth) {
            IERC20(steth).safeTransferFrom(sender, wrapper, amount);
            amount = _stethToWsteth(amount);
```
This function is used to deposit stETH to vault, however it doesn't take into account that stETH is a special token when it comes to it's transfer logic, navigating to [lido's official docs](https://docs.lido.fi/guides/lido-tokens-integration-guide/#1-2-wei-corner-case), where during transfers the amount that actually gets sent is actually a bit less than what has been specified in the transaction. More can be read on the "1-2 wei corner case" issue from https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-dao/issues/442.

This would mean that protocol would then overvalue the amount of assets that get transferred in, which would make protocol over-evaluate the value of steth.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate this vulnerability, consider using transferShares instead of direct balance transfers. or Apply the balance check 
```diff
 if (token == steth) {
+        uint256 balanceBefore = IERC20(stETH).balanceOf(address(this));
            IERC20(steth).safeTransferFrom(sender, wrapper, amount);
+        uint256 receivedAmount =  (IERC20(stETH).balanceOf(address(this)) - balanceBefore);
        receivedAmount = _stethToWsteth(receivedAmount );


```
