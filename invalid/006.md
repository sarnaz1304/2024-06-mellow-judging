# Anyone can bypass checkDeadline modifier

## Summary

The `checkDeadline` modifier in the `Vault.sol` contract is designed to prevent operations with expired `deadlines`. However, the current implementation allows users to bypass this check easily, rendering it ineffective for its intended purpose.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `checkDeadline` modifier ensures that a provided `deadline` parameter is not in the past by comparing it to the current block timestamp:

```solidity
    modifier checkDeadline(uint256 deadline) {
        if (deadline < block.timestamp) revert Deadline();
        _;
    }
```

In the `registerWithdrawal()`, `deposit()`, and `emergencyWithdraw()` functions this modifier checks user-provided `deadline` parameter. Users can easily bypass this check by setting a future deadline.

## Impact

The security check can be easily bypassed by users setting any future timestamp for the deadline, thus negating any meaningful security or operational constraints.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Introduce additional logic to validate whether the provided `deadline` is reasonable within the context of the operation. Enforce that the `deadline` cannot exceed a certain maximum duration from the current timestamp.
