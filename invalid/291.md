# `Vault.deposit()` : incorrect calculation of lp tokens

## Summary

In `Vault.deposit()`, the `totalValue` of the underlying tokens is calculated before user transfers these tokens to the vault contract, resulting in incorrect calculation of lp tokens entitled for the user.

## Vulnerability Detail

- When users call `Vault.deposit()`:

1. first the total value locked of the vaults token is calculated based on their prices and amounts, where this value is used to calculate the lp tokens minted for the depositor:

```js
totalValue +=
  totalAmounts[i] == 0
    ? 0
    : FullMath.mulDivRoundingUp(totalAmounts[i], priceX96, Q96);
```

2. then the deposited amount of each the of the underlying tokens is calculated based on the ratio of each token to the total `ratioX96`, and then transferred to the vault contract:

```js
uint256 amount = FullMath.mulDiv(ratioX96, ratiosX96[i], Q96);
IERC20(tokens[i]).safeTransferFrom(
        msg.sender,
        address(this),
        amount
        );
```

3. then the lp token amount is calculated and minted to the user via `_processLpAmount`:

```js
    function deposit(
        address to,
        uint256[] memory amounts,
        uint256 minLpAmount,
        uint256 deadline
    )
        external
        nonReentrant
        checkDeadline(deadline)
        returns (uint256[] memory actualAmounts, uint256 lpAmount)
    {
        //....
        totalValue += totalAmounts[i] == 0
                ? 0
                : FullMath.mulDivRoundingUp(totalAmounts[i], priceX96, Q96);

        //....

            uint256 amount = FullMath.mulDiv(ratioX96, ratiosX96[i], Q96);
            IERC20(tokens[i]).safeTransferFrom(
                msg.sender,
                address(this),
                amount
            );
            actualAmounts[i] = amount;
            depositValue += FullMath.mulDiv(amount, priceX96, Q96);
        }

        lpAmount = _processLpAmount(to, depositValue, totalValue, minLpAmount);

         //....the rest of the function
```

```js
   function _processLpAmount(
        address to,
        uint256 depositValue,
        uint256 totalValue,
        uint256 minLpAmount
    ) private returns (uint256 lpAmount) {
        uint256 totalSupply = totalSupply();
        if (totalSupply == 0) {
            // scenario for initial deposit
            //............
        } else {
            lpAmount = FullMath.mulDiv(depositValue, totalSupply, totalValue);
            if (lpAmount < minLpAmount) revert InsufficientLpAmount();
            if (to == address(0)) revert AddressZero();
        }

        //............
        _mint(to, lpAmount);
    }
```

- But as can be noticed; the `totalValue` is calculated **before** user transfers his tokens to the contract, resulting in `totalValue` being less than the actual value after the user transfers his tokens, thus getting higher `lpAmount`.

## Impact

This will result in users getting more lp tokens than they deserve for their depsoits, thus they will be able to withdraw way more than they deposited resulting in draining the vault funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Update `Vault.deposit()` to fetch the `totalAmounts` by the `underlyingTvl()` after the user transfers his tokens to the contract, so that the calculated `totalValue` will represent the actual value locked in the vault.
