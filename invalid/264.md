# Potential Explanation Due to Missing Rate-Limiting in Emergency Withdrawal

## Summary
The emergency withdrawal currently lacks proper rate-limiting controls. This vulnerability could be exploited to perform multiple or large-scale emergency withdrawals in a short period, potentially leading to severe issues and instability in the system 

## Vulnerability Detail
The emergency withdrawal function does not use any restrictions on the frequency or volume of withdrawals. This lack of rate-limiting allows users or malicious actors to execute substantial emergency withdrawals in rapid succession, which can quickly deplete the system's funds and affect its operational integrity 

## Impact
Rapid and multiple emergency withdrawals can drain the systemâ€™s liquidity, leading to financial instability.
Market manipulation risks: Large uncontrolled withdrawals can lead to significant token price fluctuations, enabling potential market manipulation 

## Code Snippet

/// @inheritdoc IVaultConfigurator
    function emergencyWithdrawalDelay() external view returns (uint256) {
        return _emergencyWithdrawalDelay.value;
    }

    /// @inheritdoc IVaultConfigurator
    function stageEmergencyWithdrawalDelay(
        uint256 delay_
    ) external onlyAdmin nonReentrant {
        if (delay_ > MAX_DELAY) revert InvalidDelay();
        _stage(_emergencyWithdrawalDelay, delay_);
    }

    /// @inheritdoc IVaultConfigurator
    function commitEmergencyWithdrawalDelay() external onlyAdmin nonReentrant {
        _commit(_emergencyWithdrawalDelay, _baseDelay);
    }

    /// @inheritdoc IVaultConfigurator
    function rollbackStagedEmergencyWithdrawalDelay()
        external
        onlyAdmin
        nonReentrant
    {
        _rollback(_emergencyWithdrawalDelay);
    }

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Frequency Limitations: Restrict the number of emergency withdrawals a user can initiate within a defined period and introduce a mandatory cool-down period between consecutive emergency withdrawals initiated by the same user
Amount Limitations: Cap the maximum amount of tokens that can be withdrawn in a single transaction and within a specified time frame
