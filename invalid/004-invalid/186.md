# externalCall would always revert on correct “to” address

## Summary
Incorrect implementation in the externalCall function would force the trusted calls always fail. As we can see, the developer has made a small mistake and forget to add “!” sign on `isDelegateModuleApproved` check. Due to this error every external call made to the trusted entity would fail

```solidity
function externalCall(
        address to,
        bytes calldata data
    ) external nonReentrant returns (bool success, bytes memory response) {
        _requireAtLeastOperator();
        //@audit if it isn't approved instead
        if (configurator.isDelegateModuleApproved(to)) revert Forbidden();
```

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Protocol executes the `externalCall` to the trusted entity that was previously set by the admin/owner. 
2. The function fail due to mismatch in the checks.

## Impact
The calls to the approved, trusted entities would fail

## Recommendation
Implement instead

```solidity
if (!configurator.isDelegateModuleApproved(to)) revert Forbidden();
```
