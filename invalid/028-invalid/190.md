# `_update` function from `src/Vault.sol` allows transfers to be executed when transfers should be locked

## Summary
`_update` function from `src/Vault.sol` allows transfers to be executed when transfers are locked.

## Vulnerability Detail
The following code snippet from the `_update` function from `src/Vault.sol` is problematic:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-mellow/blob/main/mellow-lrt/src/Vault.sol#L591-L596

Let's assume `configurator.areTransfersLocked()` is `true`, which means transfers are locked.

Transfers with arguments for `from` and `to` that make the condition:
`from != address(this) && to != address(this) && from != address(0) && to != address(0)` to be `true` are truly locked and the line:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-mellow/blob/main/mellow-lrt/src/Vault.sol#L595

will revert correctly.

However, let's assume the `_update` function is called with the following arguments:

- `from = address(1)` and `to = address(2)`. In this case the check:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-mellow/blob/main/mellow-lrt/src/Vault.sol#L594

will be bypassed and the line:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-mellow/blob/main/mellow-lrt/src/Vault.sol#L598

will be executed performing a transfer.

- `from = address(0)` and `to = address(1)`. In this case the check:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-mellow/blob/main/mellow-lrt/src/Vault.sol#L594

will be bypassed and the line:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-mellow/blob/main/mellow-lrt/src/Vault.sol#L598

will be executed performing a token mint, which is a token transfer.

- `from = address(1)` and `to = address(0)`. In this case the check:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-mellow/blob/main/mellow-lrt/src/Vault.sol#L594

will be bypassed and the line:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-mellow/blob/main/mellow-lrt/src/Vault.sol#L598

will be executed performing a token burn, which is a token transfer.

## Impact
Function invariant is broken. Some transfers, as shown above, will be executed even if transfers are locked (`configurator.areTransfersLocked()` is `true`). Thus, transfers can be executed when they are not expected to be executed.

## Code Snippet
In the following code snippet from `_update` function:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-mellow/blob/main/mellow-lrt/src/Vault.sol#L591-L596

when `configurator.areTransfersLocked()` is `true`, the check:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-mellow/blob/main/mellow-lrt/src/Vault.sol#L594

can be bypassed for some function arguments, as shown above, and the line:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-mellow/blob/main/mellow-lrt/src/Vault.sol#L598

can be executed when transfers are locked (`configurator.areTransfersLocked()` is `true`).

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The function `_update` should be implemented to always revert when `configurator.areTransfersLocked()` is `true`.
