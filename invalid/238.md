# ChainlinkOracle::_validateAndGetPrice will always revert if data.maxAge value is too high

## Summary
_validateAndGetPrice() function from ChainlinkOracle.sol will always revert if anytime data.maxAge > block.timestamp

## Vulnerability Detail
_validateAndGetPrice() is a private that checks whether the oracle is stale for a token price by using the maxAge parameter from the AggregatorData struct; if it happens that data.maxAge > block.timestamp the function will revert because of the way it is coded: The condition for reverting is ```solidity
if (block.timestamp - data.maxAge > lastTimestamp) revert StaleOracle();```, where ```solidity `block.timestamp - data.maxAge``` is a uint256, which means that if the result is lower than 0, it will revert because of underflow.

These function is used in both getPrice() and setChainlinkOracles() functions, what could potentially prevent them from being called.

## Impact
HIGH impact as it can potentially avoid having oracles set or prices read.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change the way in which the condition is coded without altering the state evaluate, making sure there is no underflow:

```solidity
- if (block.timestamp - data.maxAge > lastTimestamp) revert StaleOracle();
+ if (block.timestamp > lastTimestamp + data.maxAge) revert StaleOracle(); 
```
