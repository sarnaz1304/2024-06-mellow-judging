# Scaling issue for low decimal tokens

## Summary
The usage of Low decimal tokens like USDT & USDC was confirmed by sponsor in Discord . These tokens have decimal values of 6 . This causes issue , as the entire withdrawal  & depositing mechanism in Vault.sol , is written for tokens with 18 decimals only causing reverts & lockage of funds in some cases . 
## Vulnerability Detail
Let's see the withdrawal mechanism - Here the flow is - First the User has to `registerWithdrawal` then he could either withdraw by himself through `emergencyWithdraw` or he could wait for the operator to perform `processWithdrawals` . 
Here in the  `processWithdrawals` there are basically two functions called before withdrawal of funds - 
              1) `calculateStack` - which calculated the `ProcessWithdrawalsStack` 
              2) `analyzeRequest` - to analyze the validity of withdrawal request . After analyzing it returns back 2 bools -  isProcessingPossible & isWithdrawalPossible . Only when both of them are true - the withdrawal is done . 
  
Let's say the vault has 2 underlying asset - wstEth & Usdc in the ratio - 50:50
Now look at how the calculation is done in `calculateStack` , the totalValue is calculated by adding the product of underlying amount & price of tokens - (for wstEth both will be 18 decimals while for Usdc both will be 6 decimals , so wstEth amounts overpower the Usdc amounts due to scaling mistake)

```solidity
  IPriceOracle priceOracle = IPriceOracle(configurator.priceOracle());
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokens.length; i++) {
            uint256 priceX96 = priceOracle.priceX96(address(this), tokens[i]);
            s.totalValue += FullMath.mulDiv(amounts[i], priceX96, Q96);                          <@audit
            s.ratiosX96Value += FullMath.mulDiv(s.ratiosX96[i], priceX96, Q96);
            s.erc20Balances[i] = IERC20(tokens[i]).balanceOf(address(this));
        }
```
Now the same mistake is followed in `analyzeRequest` function where the `value` is calculated by amounts denominated in 18 decimals (lpAmount, s.totalValue, s.totalSupply are all calculated in 18 decimals)  . In the loop when token goes for index of wstEth it passes everything , but when the token is going for index of Usdc , the last check would not pass as `expectedAmounts` for Usdc is calculated in 18 decimals but `s.erc20Balances` as seen from `calculateStack`  was found by `balanceOf` functionality which gives it's decimals in 6 decimals . So whenever User tries to withdraw , the pattern returned by `analyzeRequest` would be - `return (true, false, expectedAmounts);` :

```solidity
 uint256 value = FullMath.mulDiv(lpAmount, s.totalValue, s.totalSupply);                                     <@audit 
        value = FullMath.mulDiv(value, D9 - s.feeD9, D9);
        uint256 coefficientX96 = FullMath.mulDiv(value, Q96, s.ratiosX96Value);                            <@audit

        uint256 length = s.erc20Balances.length;
        expectedAmounts = new uint256[](length);
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; i++) {
            uint256 ratiosX96 = s.ratiosX96[i];
            expectedAmounts[i] = ratiosX96 == 0
                ? 0
                : FullMath.mulDiv(coefficientX96, ratiosX96, Q96);                                                      <@audit
            if (expectedAmounts[i] >= request.minAmounts[i]) continue;                                       <@audit
            return (false, false, expectedAmounts);
        }
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; i++) {
            if (s.erc20Balances[i] >= expectedAmounts[i]) continue;                              <@audit 
            return (true, false, expectedAmounts);
```
This means isProcessingPossible = true & isWithdrawalPossible=false for all withdrawals so no User will be able to withdraw their funds as all withdrawal happens according to ratioX96 of assets . 

Similar case can be seen with deposit function , here the deposit functions take in the parameters where the `amount` parameter for Usdc will be in 6 decimals & for WstEth will be in 18 decimals : 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-mellow/blob/main/mellow-lrt/src/Vault.sol#L285C3-L290C6
```solidity
  function deposit(
        address to,
        uint256[] memory amounts,                              <@audit
        uint256 minLpAmount,
        uint256 deadline
    )
```
In the deposit function, it uses the functionality where lower ratio among the assets deposited will be used for further calculations and it is calculated based on the amounts passed down as parameter . For Usdc this amount will be 6 decimals & for WstEth it is in 18 Decimals causing calculation mistake in deposit functionality .   See here : 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-mellow/blob/main/mellow-lrt/src/Vault.sol#L310C9-L316C47
```solidity
  uint256 ratioX96 = type(uint256).max;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokens.length; i++) {
            if (ratiosX96[i] == 0) continue;
            uint256 ratioX96_ = FullMath.mulDiv(amounts[i], Q96, ratiosX96[i]);               <@audit
            if (ratioX96_ < ratioX96) ratioX96 = ratioX96_;
        }
        if (ratioX96 == 0) revert ValueZero();
```

## Impact
There will be Lockage of funds & severe calculation mistakes due to lack of scaling done for Low decimal tokens .

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Do the scaling properly so that the Vault can work properly with tokens with decimals < 18
