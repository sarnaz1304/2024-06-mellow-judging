# ChainlinkOracle: priceX96 Finction Fails to Account For Token Decimals

## Summary
The priceX69 function in ChainlinkOracle.sol currently does not consider the decimals of the base token and the target token when calculating prices. While this is not an issue with the current deployment using tokens from the set( weth, wsteth, steth ), it poses a potential risk for future deployments involving tokens with different decimal configurations

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability lies in the priceX96 function, which retrieves raw price data without adjusting for the different decimal places of the base and target tokens. This can lead to incorrect price calculations when the decimals of the involved tokens differ.

## Impact
Incorrect price calculations can lead to inaccurate financial operations, potentially resulting in financial losses, arbitrage opportunities, or flawed contract logic

## Code Snippet
  /// @inheritdoc IPriceOracle
    function priceX96(
        address vault,
        address token
    ) external view returns (uint256 priceX96_) {
        if (vault == address(0)) revert AddressZero();
        if (token == address(0)) revert AddressZero();
        address baseToken = baseTokens[vault];
        if (baseToken == address(0)) revert AddressZero();
        if (token == baseToken) return Q96;
        (uint256 tokenPrice, uint8 decimals) = getPrice(vault, token);
        (uint256 baseTokenPrice, uint8 baseDecimals) = getPrice(
            vault,
            baseToken
        );
        priceX96_ = FullMath.mulDiv(
            tokenPrice * 10 ** baseDecimals,
            Q96,
            baseTokenPrice * 10 ** decimals
        );


## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
1.      Fetch Decimal: IERC20(base).decimals() and IERC20(token).decimals() can provide the number of decimal places for the base token and the token being priced.

2.   Adjusted Price: Scale the rawPrice based on how many decimals of the base token are different from those of the token. If there are more decimals in the base token, multiply live by 10^( baseDecimals - tokenDecimals ). On the other hand, if there are more decimals in the token, divide the price by 10^( tokenDecimals - baseDecimals ), and if they have an equal number of decimals, then no adjustment is needed. 
This will ensure that the difference in tokens with verifying decimals will make priceX69 function to work correctly; hence making it a robust system that can scale for tokens more than just what was specified initially
