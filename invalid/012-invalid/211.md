# ChainlinkOracle unable to operate with feeds ≠ 18 decimals

## Summary

Vaults are supposed to work with LSTs, USDC, and USDT, but the current state of the ChainlinkOracle doesn’t properly scale by the token decimals.

## Vulnerability Detail

To get the price of USDC in ETH the appropriate feed should be used and unlike the LST tokens, USDC and USDT have 6 decimals. The problem is that `ChainlinkOracle` does not consider the token decimals and assumes that both baseToken and token are of 18 decimals, which will not be the case.

```solidity
function priceX96(
      address vault,
      address token
  ) external view returns (uint256 priceX96_) {
      if (vault == address(0)) revert AddressZero();
      if (token == address(0)) revert AddressZero();
      address baseToken = baseTokens[vault];
      if (baseToken == address(0)) revert AddressZero();
      if (token == baseToken) return Q96;
      (uint256 tokenPrice, uint8 decimals) = getPrice(vault, token);
      (uint256 baseTokenPrice, uint8 baseDecimals) = getPrice(
          vault,
          baseToken
      );
      priceX96_ = FullMath.mulDiv(
          tokenPrice * 10 ** baseDecimals,
          Q96,
          baseTokenPrice * 10 ** decimals
      );
  }
```

This was even mentioned by the protocol team in the contest readme but was known issue until the USDC and USDT were added as a supported underlying assets:

> In src/oracles/ChainlinkOracle.sol, the priceX96 function does not take into account IERC20(base).decimals() and IERC20(token).decimals() when converting. For the current deployment, this is not a problem because the system operates with tokens from the set [weth, wsteth, steth].

## Impact

Miscalculation of the price when stablecoins are used as underlying tokens

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Extend the ChainlinkOracle to support tokens with decimals ≠ 18
