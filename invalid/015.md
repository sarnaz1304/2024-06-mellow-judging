# L-1: Missing checks for `address(0)` when assigning values to address state variables

## Summary

Check for `address(0)` when assigning values to address state variables.

## Vulnerability Detail

Checking addresses against zero-address during initialization or during setting is a security best-practice. However, such checks are missing in address variable initializations/changes in many places. Given that zero-address is used as an indicator for BNB, there is a greater risk of using it accidentally.

## Impact

Allowing zero-addresses will lead to contract reverts and force redeployments if there are no setters for such address variables.

## Recommendation

Add zero-address checks for all initializations/setters of all address state variables.
