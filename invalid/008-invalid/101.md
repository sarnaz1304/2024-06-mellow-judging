# No Check for Price Reasonability

## Summary
The ChainlinkOracle contract doesn't implement any checks to ensure that the price returned by the oracle is within a reasonable range.

## Vulnerability Detail
The contract accepts any non-negative price from the Chainlink oracle without verifying if it's within an expected range. This could potentially allow for the use of extreme prices if the oracle is compromised or experiences a malfunction.

## Impact
Using unreasonable prices could lead to significant mispricing of assets in the protocol, potentially causing large financial losses.


## Code Snippet
```solidity
function _validateAndGetPrice(
    AggregatorData memory data
) private view returns (uint256 answer, uint8 decimals) {
    // ...
    if (signedAnswer < 0) revert InvalidOracleData();
    answer = uint256(signedAnswer);
    // No check for price reasonability
    // ...
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a price reasonability check. This could involve setting minimum and maximum acceptable prices for each asset:
```solidity
require(answer >= MIN_PRICE && answer <= MAX_PRICE, "Price out of acceptable range");
```
