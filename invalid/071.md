# Large withdraw queue will block deposits to lido

## Summary
If there is a large withdrawal queue, `convertAndDeposit` may be blocked until it is cleared, lowering the APY for the given vault.

## Vulnerability Detail
`convertAndDeposit` is called to convert all of the vault's WETH and stake it into LIDO. However, the strategy first checks if the `withdrawalQueue`'s `unfinalizedStETH` is larger than `getBufferedEther` and reverts if so.

```solidity
uint256 unfinalizedStETH = withdrawalQueue.unfinalizedStETH();
uint256 bufferedEther = ISteth(steth).getBufferedEther();
if (bufferedEther < unfinalizedStETH) {
    revert InvalidWithdrawalQueueState();
}
```
If there is a large withdrawal queue, this function will revert until the withdrawals clear, which may take days, weeks, or even months. This will, in turn, lower the APY slightly as the vault holds WETH instead of depositing it into Lido.

## Impact
Lower APY.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
uint256 unfinalizedStETH = withdrawalQueue.unfinalizedStETH();
uint256 bufferedEther = ISteth(steth).getBufferedEther();
if (bufferedEther < unfinalizedStETH) {
    revert InvalidWithdrawalQueueState();
}
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Either remove this code snippet or implement direct deposits to Lido.
