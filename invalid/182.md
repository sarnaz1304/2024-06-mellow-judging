# maxAge is set to 0, the _validateAndGetPrice always reverts.

## Summary
According to the developer comment, in the current deployment, the maxAge would be set to 0. However this is problematic, because due to 0 value, the `_validateAndGetPrice` function would always revert. 

```solidity
if (block.timestamp - data.maxAge > lastTimestamp) revert StaleOracle();
```

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Assume the Oracle retrieves the price of the USDC-USD aggregator which has a heartbeat 24 hours.
2. The _validateAndGetPrice fn retrieves the latestRoundData. Where the lastTimestamp could be in the range of < 24 hours in the past.
3. The check would compare it with the current block.timestamp which always would be bigger than lastTimestamp. 

The function would always revert.

## Impact
Function would always revert and fail to retrieve the prices.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
I highly recommend to set the relevant heartbeat for the each data feed, or eliminate this check for the current deployment.
