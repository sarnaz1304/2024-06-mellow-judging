# Wrong Function Selector Used to Call Validator

## Summary
The validator contracts will attempt to validate the wrong function, leading to failed validation checks.

## Vulnerability Detail
For example, the function `Vault::delegateCall()` is intended to invoke `validate()` to perform checks for delegation calls. It encodes the data to be validated using `abi.encodeWithSelector(msg.sig, to, data)`, and subsequently decodes function selectors from this data in validator contracts.

However, `msg.sig` represents "first four bytes of the calldata (i.e. function identifier)" ([ref](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/units-and-global-variables.html)), which is the function selector for `delegateCall(address,bytes)` in this case. This means that the function selector being passed to the validator contracts is the `delegateCall` function instead of the function that actually needs to be validated.

## Impact
Validation failed.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Save the function selector to be validated in the input `data` itself, rather than retrieving it from `msg.sig`.
