# Bonds will not work with stETH

## Summary
`stETH` rebases will get stuck inside the bond contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
`stETH` will be one of the three (or four, including ETH) whitelisted tokens.

```markdown
Whitelisted tokens:
- ETH
- WETH - https://etherscan.io/token/0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2
- STETH - https://etherscan.io/token/0xae7ab96520de3a18e5e111b5eaab095312d7fe84
- WSTETH - https://etherscan.io/token/0x7f39c581f595b53c5cb19bd0b3f8da6c935e2ca0
```
Tokens are not kept in the Vault but are deposited into bonds. However, when `stETH` is deposited into bonds with [DefaultBondModule::depost](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-mellow/blob/main/mellow-lrt/src/modules/symbiotic/DefaultBondModule.sol#L11), the bond contracts won't account for rebasing tokens. Here is an example of a bond deposit/withdrawal:

https://etherscan.deth.net/address/0xB56dA788Aa93Ed50F50e0d38641519FfB3C3D1Eb

```solidity
    function deposit(address recipient, uint256 amount) public nonReentrant returns (uint256) {
        uint256 balanceBefore = IERC20(asset).balanceOf(address(this));
        IERC20(asset).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
        amount = IERC20(asset).balanceOf(address(this)) - balanceBefore;

        if (amount == 0) {
            revert InsufficientDeposit();
        }

        if (totalSupply() + amount > limit) {
            revert ExceedsLimit();
        }

        _mint(recipient, amount);
        emit Deposit(msg.sender, recipient, amount);
        return amount;
    }

    function withdraw(address recipient, uint256 amount) external {
        if (amount == 0) {
            revert InsufficientWithdraw();
        }

        _burn(msg.sender, amount);
        IERC20(asset).safeTransfer(recipient, amount);
        emit Withdraw(msg.sender, recipient, amount);
    }
```
As shown, `deposit` and `withdraw` functions do not account for shares but simply mint/burn the deposited amount. This means that if an `stETH` rebase is triggered, the bond contract will not account for it, causing the rebase value to remain stuck inside the contract.

## Impact
The Vault loses out on `stETH` rebases.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function withdraw(address recipient, uint256 amount) external {
        if (amount == 0) {
            revert InsufficientWithdraw();
        }

        _burn(msg.sender, amount);
        IERC20(asset).safeTransfer(recipient, amount);
        emit Withdraw(msg.sender, recipient, amount);
    }
```

## Recommendation
Use bond contracts that calculate assets based on the shares owned.
