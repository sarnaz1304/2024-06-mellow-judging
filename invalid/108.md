# Reentrancy Vulnerability in emergencyWithdraw Function with ERC-777 Tokens

## Summary
The `emergencyWithdraw` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks when used with ERC-777 tokens or other tokens that have hooks that are called on transfer.


## Vulnerability Detail
While the function uses the `nonReentrant` modifier, it's still vulnerable to reentrancy through ERC-777 tokens. These tokens call a hook on the recipient before updating the token balances, which can be exploited to reenter the `emergencyWithdraw` function.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-mellow/blob/main/mellow-lrt/src/Vault.sol#L401-L416

The vulnerability occurs because the function transfers tokens before updating the internal state:

1. Tokens are transferred to the user.
2. For ERC-777 tokens, this calls a hook on the receiving contract.
3. The attacker can use this hook to call `emergencyWithdraw` again.
4. The internal state hasn't been updated yet, so the second withdrawal is processed with the same initial conditions.


## Impact
An attacker could potentially drain the vault of more tokens than they are entitled to, causing significant financial loss to the protocol.


## Code Snippet
```solidity
function emergencyWithdraw(
    uint256[] memory minAmounts,
    uint256 deadline
) external nonReentrant checkDeadline(deadline) returns (uint256[] memory actualAmounts) {
    // ... (code omitted for brevity)
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokens.length; i++) {
        // ... (code omitted for brevity)
        IERC20(tokens[i]).safeTransfer(request.to, amount);
        actualAmounts[i] = amount;
    }
    delete _withdrawalRequest[sender];
    _pendingWithdrawers.remove(sender);
    _burn(address(this), request.lpAmount);
    // ... (code omitted for brevity)
}
```
Here's a Foundry test that demonstrates the vulnerability:
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

import "forge-std/Test.sol";
import "../src/Vault.sol";
import "../src/MockERC777.sol";

contract VaultTest is Test {
    Vault vault;
    MockERC777 token;
    address attacker = address(0x1);
    
    function setUp() public {
        vault = new Vault("Test Vault", "TVLT", address(this));
        token = new MockERC777("Mock Token", "MTK", new address[](0));
        
        // Setup vault with token
        vault.addToken(address(token));
        
        // Fund vault with tokens
        token.mint(address(vault), 1000 ether);
        
        // Setup attacker with some LP tokens and a withdrawal request
        vault.deposit(attacker, [100 ether], 100 ether, block.timestamp + 1 hours);
        vm.prank(attacker);
        vault.registerWithdrawal(attacker, 100 ether, [90 ether], block.timestamp + 1 hours, block.timestamp + 2 hours, false);
    }
    
    function testReentrancyAttack() public {
        vm.prank(attacker);
        vault.emergencyWithdraw([90 ether], block.timestamp + 1 hours);
        
        // Check that attacker received more tokens than they should have
        assertGt(token.balanceOf(attacker), 100 ether);
    }
}

contract MockERC777 is ERC777 {
    constructor(string memory name, string memory symbol, address[] memory defaultOperators) 
        ERC777(name, symbol, defaultOperators) {}
    
    function mint(address account, uint256 amount) public {
        _mint(account, amount, "", "", true);
    }
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review, Foundry

## Recommendation
Implement a "checks-effects-interactions" pattern. Update the internal state before making external calls:
```solidity
function emergencyWithdraw(
    uint256[] memory minAmounts,
    uint256 deadline
) external nonReentrant checkDeadline(deadline) returns (uint256[] memory actualAmounts) {
    // ... (code omitted for brevity)
    uint256 lpAmountToBurn = request.lpAmount;
    delete _withdrawalRequest[sender];
    _pendingWithdrawers.remove(sender);
    _burn(address(this), lpAmountToBurn);
    
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokens.length; i++) {
        // ... (code omitted for brevity)
        IERC20(tokens[i]).safeTransfer(request.to, amount);
        actualAmounts[i] = amount;
    }
    // ... (code omitted for brevity)
}
```
