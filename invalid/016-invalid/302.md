# `WStethRatiosAggregatorV3.getAnswer()` always assumes `stETH:ETH` is 1:1 (pegged to ETH)

## Summary

`WStethRatiosAggregatorV3.getAnswer()` function fetches the price of `wstETH` by assuming that `stETH:ETH` is always 1:1, which is not always the case.

## Vulnerability Detail

- `WStethRatiosAggregatorV3.getAnswer()` function returns the price of `wstETH` in terms of `stETH` via `IWSteth(wsteth).getStETHByWstETH(10 ** decimals)`, as there's no chainlink oracle to fetch the `wstETH:ETH` price:

```js
    function getAnswer() public view returns (int256) {
        return int256(IWSteth(wsteth).getStETHByWstETH(10 ** decimals));
    }
```

where [`IWSteth(wsteth).getStETHByWstETH`](https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-dao/blob/5fcedc6e9a9f3ec154e69cff47c2b9e25503a78a/contracts/0.6.12/WstETH.sol#L99C1-L101C6) will return the amount of `stETH` for one `wstETH`, and then the price will be

- As can be noticed; the assumption made is that the `stETH` price is pegged to the `ETH` price therefore the `wstETH:stETH` price is used as an alternative of `wstETH:ETH` price, but this assumption is incorrect as `stETH` price has multiple incidents of depegging with the `ETH` price (the most famous one is the one where `stETH:ETH` price hits 0.9394 on 20th of June 2022)

## Impact

This would result in incorrect valuation of `wstETH` vaults assets when the `stETH:ETH` price depegs, resulting in incorrect calculation of lp tokens minted for the users at the time of depegging.

## Recommendation

Aggregate multiple chainlink oracles to extract the required price.
