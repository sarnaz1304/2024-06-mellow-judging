# Bad price assumption that stETH equals WETH

## Summary
Protocol should not make the assumption that price of stETH == price of WETH.
## Vulnerability Detail
In WStethRatiosAggregatorV3, price of wstETH is calculated in terms of stETH. However, the underlying token should be WETH. Since stETH tracks but does not mirror the price of WETH, the price is inaccurate.

```solidity
// WStethRatiosAggregatorV3.sol

function getAnswer() public view returns (int256) {
        return int256(IWSteth(wsteth).getStETHByWstETH(10 ** decimals));
    }
```

## Impact
In a depeg scenario, which could happen if there is a of loss of confidence in stETH (e.g. bug in Lido contracts), the price gap between stETH and WETH would widen and would affect vault operations such as deposits and withdrawals which rely on the price for calculation of TVL and tokens to transfer in/out.

## Recommendation
Take extra steps to convert stETH price to ETH such as using Chainlink's stETH/ETH price feed.
