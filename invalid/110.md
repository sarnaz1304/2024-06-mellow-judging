# Lack of Withdrawal Queue

## Summary
The contract doesn't implement a withdrawal queue, which could lead to unfair advantage for some users during liquidity crunches.


## Vulnerability Detail
In the current implementation, withdrawals are processed on a first-come-first-served basis. This could lead to a "bank run" scenario where users rush to withdraw, potentially leaving later withdrawers unable to access their funds.


## Impact
During periods of low liquidity, some users might be unable to withdraw their funds, leading to potential losses or locked assets.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function processWithdrawals(
    address[] memory users
) external nonReentrant returns (bool[] memory statuses) {
    // ... (code omitted for brevity)
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < users.length; i++) {
        // ... (processes withdrawals in the order provided)
    }
    // ...
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a fair withdrawal queue system where withdrawal requests are processed in the order they are received, regardless of when the processWithdrawals function is called.
