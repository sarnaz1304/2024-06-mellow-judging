# Adding a new token would make all pending withdrawal requests invalid

## Summary
In the current implementation of the withdrawal management system, there is a flaw that invalidates a user's withdrawal request if new tokens are added to the system during the processing time. This issue arises due to the check that compares the tokensHash at the time of request with the current tokensHash in the system. If any new token (e.g., USDC) is added after the request is made but before it is processed, the hash comparison fails, rendering the withdrawal request invalid. This forces the user to wait until the deadline to use the emergencyWithdraw function or to create another withdrawal request.

## Vulnerability Detail

Step 1: User (Alice) deposits two tokens (e.g., WETH and stETH).
Step 2: Alice submits a withdrawal request for the deposited tokens.
Step 3: While the withdrawal request is still pending, the admin adds a new token (e.g., USDC) to the system.
Step 4: The system compares `request.tokensHash` with `s.tokensHash` and finds a mismatch due to the addition of the new token.
Step 5: Alice's withdrawal request becomes invalid and she needs either to create a new withdrawal request or to wait until deadline will pass and she will be able to withdraw her funds via `emergencyWithdraw` function

## Impact
Users withdrawal request would become invalid even if they were correct for the time of creation and they would be forced to send withdrawal request again.

## Recommendation

Modify the withdrawal logic to decouple the token hash validation from the current state of the token set. Instead, validate against the token set that existed at the time of the request.
