# `emergencyWithdraw`  doesn't impose a fee

## Summary
The [emergencyWithdraw](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-mellow/blob/main/mellow-lrt/src/Vault.sol#L371) function doesn't have the ability to charge a fee.

## Vulnerability Detail
Currently, the system is initialized with a `feeD9` of 0, making normal withdrawals fee-less. However, since the `feeD9` variable exists, it is expected that the system should be able to charge a fee if needed.

This is not the case for [emergencyWithdraw](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-mellow/blob/main/mellow-lrt/src/Vault.sol#L371) as it lacks any fee mechanisms, making emergency withdrawals free. If emergency withdrawal waiting times are reduced, this issue will become even more problematic.

## Impact
Users can use emergency withdraw to withdraw without a fee.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokens.length; i++) {
    if (amounts[i] == 0) {
        if (minAmounts[i] != 0) revert InsufficientAmount();
        continue;
    }

    uint256 amount = FullMath.mulDiv(
        IERC20(tokens[i]).balanceOf(address(this)),
        request.lpAmount,
        totalSupply
    );

    if (amount < minAmounts[i]) revert InsufficientAmount();
    IERC20(tokens[i]).safeTransfer(request.to, amount);
    actualAmounts[i] = amount;
}
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Apply the same `feeD9` used in `analyzeRequest` to [emergencyWithdraw](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-mellow/blob/main/mellow-lrt/src/Vault.sol#L371).
