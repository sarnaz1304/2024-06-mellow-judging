# L-3: Define and use `constant` variables instead of using literals

## Summary

If the same constant literal value is used multiple times, create a constant state variable and reference it throughout the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

Repeated use of the same literal value can lead to inefficient and harder-to-maintain code. Defining a constant state variable for such values can improve readability, maintainability, and potentially optimize gas usage.

## Impact

- Readability: Code becomes easier to understand since constants provide meaningful names for the values.
- Maintainability: If the constant value needs to be changed, it can be updated in one place.
- Gas Efficiency: Using constants can reduce gas costs as the value is stored only once in the bytecode.

## Recommendation

Identify constant literal values used multiple times in your contract. Define them as constant state variables and reference these variables throughout your contract to improve readability, maintainability, and gas efficiency.
