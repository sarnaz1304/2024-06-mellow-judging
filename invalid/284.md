# Front-Running Vulnerability in `registerWithdrawal`

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
function registerWithdrawal(
    address to,
    uint256 lpAmount,
    uint256[] memory minAmounts,
    uint256 deadline,
    uint256 requestDeadline,
    bool closePrevious
)
    external
    nonReentrant
    checkDeadline(deadline)
    checkDeadline(requestDeadline)
{
    // Function implementation (as previously discussed)
    // ...
}
```
identifying Target Transaction: When a legitimate user (Alice) submits a `registerWithdrawal` transaction, the attacker observes the transaction details and identifies the parameters (e.g., `to`,` lpAmount`, `minAmounts`).

Front-Running Execution:

- Before Alice's transaction gets mined, the attacker sends their own transaction with a higher gas price and modifies the parameters slightly to their advantage:
- `Increase lpAmount`: The attacker increases the lpAmount to withdraw more tokens than Alice intended, consuming more LP tokens than Alice.
- Adjust `minAmounts`: The attacker can modify the `minAmounts` array to set lower minimum amounts for token withdrawals, potentially reducing the withdrawal amount for some tokens.
- Adjust `to` address: The attacker changes the to address to divert the tokens to their own address instead of Alice's.
- Transaction Execution: Miners prioritize the attacker's transaction due to the higher gas price, executing it before Alice's transaction. As a result:

The attacker withdraws a larger amount of LP tokens and potentially diverts tokens intended for Alice to their own address.
Alice's intended withdrawal may fail or result in lesser tokens than expected due to reduced LP tokens available.
```solidity
// Assume attacker deploys this contract to execute the attack
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

interface Vault {
    function registerWithdrawal(
        address to,
        uint256 lpAmount,
        uint256[] calldata minAmounts,
        uint256 deadline,
        uint256 requestDeadline,
        bool closePrevious
    ) external;

    // Other required functions and events from Vault contract...
}

contract FrontRunningAttack {
    Vault public vaultContract;
    address public attackerAddress;

    constructor(address _vaultContract) {
        vaultContract = Vault(_vaultContract);
        attackerAddress = msg.sender;
    }

    function performAttack() external {
        address[] memory tokens; // Define tokens array as required
        uint256[] memory minAmounts; // Define minAmounts array as required
        uint256 lpAmount = 100 ether; // Example: Withdraw 100 LP tokens
        uint256 deadline = block.timestamp + 300; /
```
## Impact
Financial Loss: Alice may lose tokens due to the attacker withdrawing more LP tokens or redirecting tokens elsewhere.
