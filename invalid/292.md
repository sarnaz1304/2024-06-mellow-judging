# `Vault.emergencyWithdraw()` enables depositors to withdraw way more then their deposited value

## Summary

`Vault.emergencyWithdraw()` enables depositors to withdraw more tokens than they are entitle to if a new module is added after they have deposited.

## Vulnerability Detail

- Depositors can call `Vault.emergencyWithdraw()` function to withdraw their funds directly (as long as the withdraw request deadline hasn't passed) if their withdrawal request is not processed via `Vault.processWithdrawals()` when their request tokens hash doesn't match the current tokens hash which represents the current `_underlyingTokens` supported by the vault (when the admin adds/removes a supported underlying token).

- So in the case where a new module is added to the vault (that has new tokens): it was noticed that `Vault.emergencyWithdraw()` function transfers to the depositors these new tokens based on their lp tokens balance, so the more new modules with new tokens added to the vault (more total value locked in the vault), the more the depositors can withdraw from the vault regardless of the **value** of the underlying tokens they have deposited before withdrawal:

```js
function emergencyWithdraw(
        uint256[] memory minAmounts,
        uint256 deadline
    )
        external
        nonReentrant
        checkDeadline(deadline)
        returns (uint256[] memory actualAmounts)
    {
     //...
        (address[] memory tokens, uint256[] memory amounts) = baseTvl();

        if (minAmounts.length != tokens.length) revert InvalidLength();
    //...
            uint256 amount = FullMath.mulDiv(
                IERC20(tokens[i]).balanceOf(address(this)),
                request.lpAmount,
                totalSupply
            );
            IERC20(tokens[i]).safeTransfer(request.to, amount);
    //...
    }
```

## Impact

Depositors withdrawing more than their provided value, resulting in draining vaults funds.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement a mechanism to cache the present tokens at the time of deposit, so users will be only allowed to withdraw what they have provided (same value).
