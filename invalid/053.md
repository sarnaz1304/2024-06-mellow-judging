# Missing deposit availability checks will revert the whole `deposit()` function

## Summary
Lido has a daily limit on staking eth and if the limit is reached the transaction would revert

## Vulnerability Detail

According to the [lido docs](https://docs.lido.fi/guides/lido-tokens-integration-guide/#staking-rate-limits) the current staking limit is 150_000 and protocols should check `getCurrentStakeLimit() >= amountToStake` the staking limit before depositing.

The `DepositWrapper` contracts deposit function takes in `ETH`, `WETH`, `StETH` or `WStETH`. It wraps the selected token to `WStETH` if it is not wrapped staked eth. If a user is to deposit ETH  amount more than the lido staking limit that is left the transaction would revert.

## Impact
The users will not be able to stake their funds
