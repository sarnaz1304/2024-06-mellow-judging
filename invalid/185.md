# Vault is set as immutable in depositWrapper?

## Summary
`DepositWrapper` serves to be an entry point into the Vault. The main purpose of it is to convert tokens into the `wsETH`, which will be further deposited into the Melow protocol. However, the problem is, that according to the developer comment, the Vault.sol is expected to be upgradable, but in the `DepositWrapper` contract, the vault address it set as an immutable variable

```solidity
IVault public immutable vault;
```

It dangerous assumption, because when the Vault.sol will be upgraded, in the `DepositWrapper` the old address of the Vault will remain and the user who would like to deposit they funds would simply loose them.

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Owner upgrade the Vault.sol and it is deployed on the new address
2. User call deposit function in the `DepositWrapper`.
3. Funds are deposited into the old/incorrect address and they are simply lost.

## Impact
The user’s could loose their funds, because an amount will be transfered into an incorrect(old) Vault address.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Create the function in the DepositWrapper that would allow to change the Vault.sol address, and don’t make it immutable.
