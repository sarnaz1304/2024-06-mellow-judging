# [H-01] Lack of Heartbeat Check

## Summary
The ChainlinkOracle contract does not implement a heartbeat check, which could lead to the use of stale data.

## Vulnerability Detail
The contract only checks if the data is older than a specified `maxAge` in the `_validateAndGetPrice` function. However, it doesn't verify when the last update occurred within this timeframe. This could allow the use of data that hasn't been updated recently enough, even if it's within the `maxAge` limit.

## Impact
Using stale price data could lead to incorrect pricing in the protocol, potentially causing significant financial losses for users or the protocol itself.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function _validateAndGetPrice(
    AggregatorData memory data
) private view returns (uint256 answer, uint8 decimals) {
    // ...
    if (block.timestamp - data.maxAge > lastTimestamp) revert StaleOracle();
    // ...
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a heartbeat check in addition to the maxAge check. This could involve storing the last update time and ensuring that it's within an acceptable range:
```solidity
if (block.timestamp - lastUpdateTime > HEARTBEAT_PERIOD) revert StaleOracle();
```
