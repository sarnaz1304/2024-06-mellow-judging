# Inconsistent LP Token Calculation and Withdrawal Process in Emergency Withdrawals

## Summary
The contract's emergency withdrawal mechanism and LP token calculation have inconsistencies. During deposits, LP tokens are calculated based on the totalValue, which includes both debt and non-debt tokens. However, during emergency withdrawals, the amount to be withdrawn is calculated using the contract's token balance instead of the total value from TVL, leading to potential discrepancies and unfair withdrawal amounts.
## Vulnerability Detail
The _processLpAmount function uses the formula:
```javascript 
lpAmount = FullMath.mulDiv(depositValue, totalSupply, totalValue);

```
here totalValue is the sum of all underlying tokens, including both debt and non-debt tokens.

However, in the emergencyWithdraw function, the withdrawal amount is calculated using:
```javascript 
uint256 amount = FullMath.mulDiv(
    IERC20(tokens[i]).balanceOf(address(this)),
    request.lpAmount,
    totalSupply
);

```
This approach only considers the balance of the tokens in the contract and ignores the debt amounts that are included in totalValue during the deposit calculation.

Additionally, the current implementation cancels a withdrawal request if the deadline has passed, instead of performing an emergency withdrawal as expected.
## Impact
nconsistent Withdrawal Amounts: Users may receive an incorrect amount of tokens during an emergency withdrawal, as the calculation does not align with the initial deposit calculation.
Potential Exploitation: Users might exploit these inconsistencies to gain more tokens during withdrawals or to prevent others from withdrawing.
Denial of Service (DoS): Attackers can intentionally create conditions where legitimate users cannot perform emergency withdrawals due to the discrepancies in calculations.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Ensure that the withdrawal amount calculation aligns with the deposit calculation by including both debt and non-debt tokens in the totalValue.
