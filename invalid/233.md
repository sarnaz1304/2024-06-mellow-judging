# User could send some tokens directly to the Vault and DoS the contract due to maximalTotalSupply limit.

## Summary
When other tokens (apart from the wsETH) will be deposited in the Vault, their totalValue (balanceOf) would be 0. I have submitted an issue that if the minLpAmount would be set to 0, the first depositor could loose the money. However, there is also a tricky edge case, if the first depositor make a deposit, the attacker could front run them and send small amount of tokens directly into the contract. It means that when the calculation of the _processLpAmount will happen to mint token, it can be tricked to mint a huge amount of tokens, potentially reaching the limit of max supply and make the contract DoS.

## Vulnerability Detail
1. First depositor want to deposit 100e6 USDC tokens (could also be another token)
2. Attacker front run them and send very small amount of token (it should be adjusted to exactly reach the limit)
3. The huge amount of Lp is minted, the maximalTotalSupply is reached.
Assume there are 5 Lp tokens minted and 0 balanceOf the USDC
User deposit 100e6 tokens.
Attacker directly sends 1e5 tokens
lpAmount = FullMath.mulDiv(depositValue, totalSupply, totalValue);
lpAmount = 100e6 * 5 / 100000
= 5000 LP amount could be minted (the number could be adjusted to reach the limit)

## Impact
maximalTotalSupply could be reached and DoS the Vault contract

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Make a thorough check related to the first time deposit, re-implement the logic
