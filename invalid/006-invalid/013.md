# User can abuse emergencyWithdraw to withdraw multiple tokens

## Summary

User can abuse emergencyWithdraw to withdraw multiple tokens

## Vulnerability Detail

when user executes [emergencyWithdraw](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-mellow/blob/26aa0445ec405a4ad637bddeeedec4efe1eba8d2/mellow-lrt/src/Vault.sol#L396) after user create withdraw requests

```solidity
   function emergencyWithdraw(
        uint256[] memory minAmounts,
        uint256 deadline
    )
        external
        nonReentrant
        checkDeadline(deadline)
        returns (uint256[] memory actualAmounts)
    {
```

user can specify a list of minAmounts, which matches the current token list avaiable

```solidity
  (address[] memory tokens, uint256[] memory amounts) = baseTvl();
        if (minAmounts.length != tokens.length) revert InvalidLength();
        actualAmounts = new uint256[](tokens.length);

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokens.length; i++) {
            if (amounts[i] == 0) {
                if (minAmounts[i] != 0) revert InsufficientAmount();
                continue;
            }
            uint256 amount = FullMath.mulDiv(
                IERC20(tokens[i]).balanceOf(address(this)),
                request.lpAmount,
                totalSupply
            );
            if (amount < minAmounts[i]) revert InsufficientAmount();
            IERC20(tokens[i]).safeTransfer(request.to, amount);
            actualAmounts[i] = amount;
        }
```

but the problem is that between the user create withdraw and the emergency withdraw is executed, new token can be added.

consider the case:

1. admin whitelist two token by calling 

```solidity
   /// @notice Adds a new token to the list of underlying tokens in the vault.
    /// @dev Only accessible by an admin.
    /// @param token The address of the token to add.
    function addToken(address token) external;
```

2. user mint lp token by deposit these two tokens. [token A, token B]

3. user create withdraw request.

4. admin add new token (token C)

5. more user deposit token C into the vault.

6. user exceute the emergencyWithdraw, while only deposit 2 token, he can now withdraw 3 tokens even he never makde token 3 deposit by specifing a list of minAmount corresponding to [tokenA, token B, token C]

when user [create withdraw](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-mellow/blob/26aa0445ec405a4ad637bddeeedec4efe1eba8d2/mellow-lrt/src/Vault.sol#L371), the token hash field is set to snapshot which token are available to withdraw:

```solidity
        WithdrawalRequest memory request = WithdrawalRequest({
            to: to,
            lpAmount: lpAmount,
            tokensHash: keccak256(abi.encode(tokens)),
            minAmounts: minAmounts,
            deadline: requestDeadline,
            timestamp: timestamp
        });
```

the root cause is that when the withdraw is processed normally,

the code validate if the the tokensHash is the same:

```solidity
  function analyzeRequest(
        ProcessWithdrawalsStack memory s,
        WithdrawalRequest memory request
    ) public pure returns (bool, bool, uint256[] memory expectedAmounts) {
        uint256 lpAmount = request.lpAmount;
        if (
 @           request.tokensHash != s.tokensHash || request.deadline < s.timestamp
        ) return (false, false, expectedAmounts);

```

and if the token list is changed, the withdraw request is skipped, 

but the same validating is missing in emergency withdraw,

this allow user to withdraw more fund (more token via emergency withdraw)

## Impact

lose of fund

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

in emergency withdraw, validate 

```solidity
 request.tokensHash == s.tokensHash
``` 

as well.
