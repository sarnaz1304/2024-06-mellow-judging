# calling `emergencyWithdraw(...)` can prematurely can withdrawals

## Summary
Per the protocols [documentation](https://docs.mellow.finance/mellow-lrt-primitive/lrt-contracts/vault), 
> If a user's request is not processed within the emergencyWithdrawalDelay period, the user can perform an emergency withdrawal

When `emergencyWithdraw(...)` is called, as seen on `L384` it first intends to check if the users withdrawal request deadline has passed and then cancels the request

```solidity
File: Vault.sol
371:     function emergencyWithdraw(
372:         uint256[] memory minAmounts,
373:         uint256 deadline
374:     )
375:         external
376:         nonReentrant
377:         checkDeadline(deadline)
378:         returns (uint256[] memory actualAmounts)
379:     {
380:         uint256 timestamp = block.timestamp;
381:         address sender = msg.sender;
382:         if (!_pendingWithdrawers.contains(sender)) revert InvalidState();
383:         WithdrawalRequest memory request = _withdrawalRequest[sender];
384: @>      if (timestamp > request.deadline) { // @audit if request deadline has passed cancel request
385: @>          _cancelWithdrawalRequest(sender);
386:             return actualAmounts;
387:         }

```


## Vulnerability Detail
The problem is that the logic check used here is wrong because if the request deadline had passed, going by the documentation, the request should be eligible for an emergency withdrawal, but in the implementation the request is cancelled as seen on `L385` above

## Impact
Withdrawals can be cancelled prematurely breaking core protocol functionality

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Modify the `emergencyWithdraw(...)` function as shown below to ensure user can success fully use the function without breaking core protocol functionality

```solidity
File: Vault.sol
371:     function emergencyWithdraw(
372:         uint256[] memory minAmounts,
373:         uint256 deadline
374:     )
375:         external
376:         nonReentrant
377:         checkDeadline(deadline)
378:         returns (uint256[] memory actualAmounts)
379:     {
380:         uint256 timestamp = block.timestamp;
381:         address sender = msg.sender;
382:         if (!_pendingWithdrawers.contains(sender)) revert InvalidState();
383:         WithdrawalRequest memory request = _withdrawalRequest[sender];
384:  -     if (timestamp > request.deadline) { // @audit if request deadline has passed cancel request
385:  -           _cancelWithdrawalRequest(sender);
386:  -          return actualAmounts;
387:  -     }

```
