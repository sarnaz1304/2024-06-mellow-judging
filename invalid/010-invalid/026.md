# Users who try to emergency withdraw funds may have slippage loss.

## Summary
Users who try to emergency withdraw funds may have slippage loss.

## Vulnerability Detail
`Vault.sol#emergencyWithdraw` function is the following.
```solidity
    function emergencyWithdraw(
        uint256[] memory minAmounts,
        uint256 deadline
    )
        external
        nonReentrant
        checkDeadline(deadline)
        returns (uint256[] memory actualAmounts)
    {
        uint256 timestamp = block.timestamp;
        address sender = msg.sender;
        if (!_pendingWithdrawers.contains(sender)) revert InvalidState();
        WithdrawalRequest memory request = _withdrawalRequest[sender];
384:    if (timestamp > request.deadline) {
            _cancelWithdrawalRequest(sender);
            return actualAmounts;
        }

        if (
390:        request.timestamp + configurator.emergencyWithdrawalDelay() >
            timestamp
        ) revert InvalidState();

        ......
    }
```
As can be seen from `L384` and `L390`, if `request.deadline` is before than `request.timestamp + configurator.emergencyWithdrawalDelay()`, emergency withdraw is impossible.
So, users who want to emergency withdraw funds have to set request deadline to be later than emergency withdraw delay.

However, the emergency withdraw delay may be long. 
For instance, it is 90 days in the `DeployScript.sol`.
This may cause users who try to emergency withdraw have slippage loss.

Scenario:
1. Assume that for a certain reason, administrator and operators don't process withdraw requests for a long time.
2. So a user sets request deadline to be later (ex: > 90 days) than emergency withdraw delay and registers withdraw request in order to withdraw funds through emergency withdraw.
3. Some times (ex: 30 days) later, administrator and operators begin to process withdraw requests again.
Since long time passes and price may changes a lot, the user may have slippage loss this time.

## Impact
Users who try to emergency withdraw funds have to set request deadline to be later than emergency withdraw delay.
So they may have slippage loss in the case that emergency withdraw delay is long.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Modify `Vault.sol#emergencyWithdraw` function as follows.
```solidity
    function emergencyWithdraw(
        uint256[] memory minAmounts,
        uint256 deadline
    )
        external
        nonReentrant
        checkDeadline(deadline)
        returns (uint256[] memory actualAmounts)
    {
        uint256 timestamp = block.timestamp;
        address sender = msg.sender;
        if (!_pendingWithdrawers.contains(sender)) revert InvalidState();
        WithdrawalRequest memory request = _withdrawalRequest[sender];
--      if (timestamp > request.deadline) {
--          _cancelWithdrawalRequest(sender);
--          return actualAmounts;
--      }

        if (
            request.timestamp + configurator.emergencyWithdrawalDelay() >
            timestamp
        ) revert InvalidState();
    }
```
Since `emergencyWithdraw` function already have slippage control through `minAmounts` and `deadline` parameter, `L384-L386` is not neccessary.
On the other hand, if the user wants to cancel withdraw request, he/she can call the `cancelWithdrawalRequest` function directly.
