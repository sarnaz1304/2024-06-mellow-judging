# Redundant check in `emergencyWithdraw()` makes the function almost unusable

## Summary

Redundant check in `emergencyWithdraw()` makes the function almost unusable. This is because the function will almost always cancel the request instead of withdrawing the users' funds:

```solidity
        if (timestamp > request.deadline) {
            _cancelWithdrawalRequest(sender);
            return actualAmounts;
        }
```

## Vulnerability Detail

The `emergencyWithdraw` function allows users to withdraw their share of the vault's assets in an emergency situation. 

```solidity
    function emergencyWithdraw(
        uint256[] memory minAmounts,
        uint256 deadline
    )
        external
        nonReentrant
        checkDeadline(deadline)
        returns (uint256[] memory actualAmounts)
    {
        uint256 timestamp = block.timestamp;
        address sender = msg.sender;
        if (!_pendingWithdrawers.contains(sender)) revert InvalidState();
        WithdrawalRequest memory request = _withdrawalRequest[sender];

        if (timestamp > request.deadline) {
            _cancelWithdrawalRequest(sender);
            return actualAmounts;
        }
```

According to the configuration, 90 days must pass to use this function:

```solidity
        if (
            request.timestamp + configurator.emergencyWithdrawalDelay() >
            timestamp
        ) revert InvalidState();
```

```solidity
require(setup.configurator.emergencyWithdrawalDelay() == 90 days);
```

But before this check there is a completely unnecessary check which will cancel the request:

```solidity
        if (timestamp > request.deadline) {
            _cancelWithdrawalRequest(sender);
            return actualAmounts;
        }
```

This check cancels the withdrawal request if the current timestamp is greater than the request deadline. That is, when a user makes a withdrawal request he chooses by what time(deadline) he wants it to be executed. Almost never it will be more than 90 days.

Any value below `configurator.emergencyWithdrawalDelay` will enter the above code check and cancel the withdraw request.

This means that if an emergency happens, instead of users withdrawing their funds, the request will be cancelled.
## Impact

The function is almost unusable. In the event of an emergency, instead of users saving their funds, the request will be canceled, and they may lose them.

## Recommendation

Remove the following check:

```solidity
        if (timestamp > request.deadline) {
            _cancelWithdrawalRequest(sender);
            return actualAmounts;
        }
```
