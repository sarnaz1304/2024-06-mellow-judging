# Blacklisted users will not be able to withdraw their funds

## Summary
Blacklisted users will not be able to withdraw their funds because even a small amount of USDT will cause `processWithdrawals` to revert.

## Vulnerability Detail
`processWithdrawals` withdraws a portion of all the underlying tokens in the Vault using a push method instead of a pull method. If a user is blacklisted for any of the tokens (e.g., USDT), the transaction will revert.

```solidity
            for (uint256 j = 0; j < s.tokens.length; j++) {
                s.erc20Balances[j] -= expectedAmounts[j];
                IERC20(s.tokens[j]).safeTransfer(request.to, expectedAmounts[j]);
            }
```
Withdrawals can still happen if the operator excludes the blacklisted user. This means a blacklisted user cannot withdraw their funds.

Example:
1. User1 deposits into a vault with 10% USDT, 10% USDC, and 80% wstETH.
2. User1 gets blacklisted for USDT.
3. User1 cannot withdraw, even though only 10% of their balance is blacklisted.

## Impact
Blacklisted users will not be able to withdraw their funds.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
            for (uint256 j = 0; j < s.tokens.length; j++) {
                s.erc20Balances[j] -= expectedAmounts[j];
                IERC20(s.tokens[j]).safeTransfer(request.to, expectedAmounts[j]);
            }
```

## Recommendation
I am not aware of any simple one liner fixes, my only suggestion is to implement pull instead of push on withdrawals.
