# Deposit will revert due to strict ratioX96 == 0 check

## Summary
Deposit will revert due to strict ratioX96 == 0 check

## Vulnerability Detail
When a user deposits using Vault::deposit(), he pass an array of deposited amounts which he wanted to deposit. 

To understand this issue, lets go step by step:
1. Suppose added tokens are WETH, RETH, WSTETH respectively, and user wanted to deposit 10 WSTETH
2. amounts[] will be [0, 0, 10], not [10] because deposit() will deposit the WETH instead of WSTETH
3. ratioX96_ is calculated based on the amount[ i ] and set in ratioX96, if(ratioX96_ < ratioX96)
```solidity
    @>    uint256 ratioX96 = type(uint256).max;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokens.length; i++) {
            if (ratiosX96[i] == 0) continue;
            uint256 ratioX96_ = FullMath.mulDiv(amounts[i], Q96, ratiosX96[i]);
  @>        if (ratioX96_ < ratioX96) ratioX96 = ratioX96_;
        }
  @>      if (ratioX96 == 0) revert ValueZero();
```
4. Now the problem is above (ratioX96 == 0) check because it will revert the deposit of any token except WETH ie first token, lets see how 
5. ratioX96_ for WETH will be 0 because its amount is 0, therefore ratioX96 will be also 0
6. ratioX96_ for RETH will be 0 because its amount is 0, therefore ratioX96 will be also 0
7. Now for WSTETH, ratioX96_ will be > 0 because amount is > 0(ie 10) but ratioX96 still be 0 because ratioX96_ > ratioX96
8. Because of above (ratioX96 == 0) check, deposit will  revert even though user wanted to deposit token

## Impact
User will not be able to deposit, if first token deposit amount is 0 because it directly sets the ratioX96 = 0 which reverts the transaction
