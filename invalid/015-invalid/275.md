# USDT fee on transfer will cause losses

## Summary
USDT fee on transfer will cause losses

## Vulnerability Detail
USDT is a fee-on transfer token which can have fee enabled. If the fees is enabled, it will lead to a percentage of assets being taxed on transfers. This will cause the deposit function to give an inflated amount of shares for later depositors (because the fees of the previous depositors would be already considered while the fees on the about to be deposited amount is not considered) and also an unfair valuation for early with-drawers (because for each processWithdrawal call, the entire amount is taken out and redeposited and the fees on the later transfer is borne solely by the remaining non-withdrawing depositors)

```solidity
    function deposit(
        address to,
        uint256[] memory amounts,
        uint256 minLpAmount,
        uint256 deadline,
        uint256 referralCode
    )
    ........
                uint256 amount = FullMath.mulDiv(ratioX96, ratiosX96[i], Q96);
                IERC20(tokens[i]).safeTransferFrom(
                    msg.sender,
                    address(this),
                    amount
                );
                actualAmounts[i] = amount;
                depositValue += FullMath.mulDiv(amount, priceX96, Q96);
```

```solidity
    function _processWithdrawals(address[] memory users) private {
     .....
        vault.processWithdrawals(users);
        _deposit();
```

## Impact
Incorrect valuation of assets which will be used during deposits and withdrawals giving unfair advantage to some user's at the expense of others
