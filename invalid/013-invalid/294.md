# `withdraw` in `Vault` allows withdrawing `to` to be non `msg.sender` this opens the gate for attacks and greifing by malcious user to revert `processAll` and any array provided withdrawal functions by withrawing `to` blacklisted users

## Summary
the function `withdraw` in `Vault` allows withdrawing `to` to be non `msg.sender` this opens the gate for attacks and greifing by malcious user to revert `processAll` and any array provided withdrawal functions by withrawing `to` blacklisted users  

## Vulnerability Detail
the function `withdraw` in `Vault` allows withdrawing `to` non `msg.sender` this opens the gate for attacks and greifing by malcious user to revert `processAll` and any array provided withdrawal functions by withrawing to blacklisted users

lets see how

```solidity
File: Vault.sol
434:     function registerWithdrawal(
435:         address to,
436:         uint256 lpAmount,
437:         uint256[] memory minAmounts,
438:         uint256 deadline,
439:         uint256 requestDeadline,
440:         bool closePrevious
441:     )
442:         external
443:         nonReentrant
444:         checkDeadline(deadline)
445:         checkDeadline(requestDeadline)
446:     {
447:         uint256 timestamp = block.timestamp;
448:         address sender = msg.sender;
449:         if (_pendingWithdrawers.contains(sender)) {
450:             if (!closePrevious) revert InvalidState();
451:             _cancelWithdrawalRequest(sender);
452:         }
453:         uint256 balance = balanceOf(sender);
454:         if (lpAmount > balance) lpAmount = balance;
455:         if (lpAmount == 0) revert ValueZero();
456:         if (to == address(0)) revert AddressZero();
457: 
458:         address[] memory tokens = _underlyingTokens;
459:         if (tokens.length != minAmounts.length) revert InvalidLength();
460: 
461:         WithdrawalRequest memory request = WithdrawalRequest({
462:             to: to,
463:             lpAmount: lpAmount,
464:             tokensHash: keccak256(abi.encode(tokens)),
465:             minAmounts: minAmounts,
466:             deadline: requestDeadline,
467:             timestamp: timestamp
468:         });
469:         _withdrawalRequest[sender] = request;
470:         _pendingWithdrawers.add(sender);
471:         _transfer(sender, address(this), lpAmount);
472:         emit WithdrawalRequested(sender, request);
473:     }

```

the problem may arrise from the fact that user use different accounts to register to different black listed user which will make any list has a black listed user in it during withdrawals leading to almost always reverts

cause one may say we can get a list from an `offset` after the index of the blacklisted users here 

```solidity
    function pendingWithdrawers(
        uint256 limit,
        uint256 offset
    ) external view returns (address[] memory result) {
        EnumerableSet.AddressSet storage withdrawers_ = _pendingWithdrawers;
        uint256 count = withdrawers_.length();
        if (offset >= count || limit == 0) return result;
        count -= offset;
        if (count > limit) count = limit;
        result = new address[](count);
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < count; i++) {
            result[i] = withdrawers_.at(offset + i);
        }
        return result;
    }
```

but user can repeatedly register different withdrawals every 2 users withdrawals leading to different txns reverts and making using array of withdrawals impractical forcing the operator to process withdrawals 2 by 2 to stay away from the index of the blacklisted address



## Impact
medium, breaks core contract functionality since there is no off-chain handling mentioned in the readME, the problem gets worth if those delays and reverts to operators forces users to emergency withdraw leading to loss of funds to them

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
in the proccess withdrawal function make sure to check if the `token[i]` is `usdc` or `usdt` and check if user is blacklisted
