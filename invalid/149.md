# `ChainlinkOracle` contract allows admin to add adress(0) aggregator which will lead to the block of `getPrice`  function

## Summary
`ChainlinkOracle::setChainlinkOracles` check whether data_[i].aggregatorV3 == address(0) to skip validation, but still adds it to the _aggregatorsData mapping

## Vulnerability Detail
Admin can add Chainlink address(0) aggregator. Even though the check is present here for this case, it skips validation but still allows admin to add the broken aggregator to the `_aggregatorsData` mapping. When user calls `getPrice` function, it can revert due to calling address(0) as a chainlink aggreagator

## Impact
Can temporary block the price fetching functionality
