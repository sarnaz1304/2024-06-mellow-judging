# Malicious users can withdraw far more than the amount they deposited with the `emergencyWithdraw(...)` function.

## Summary
The emergency withdraw function uses the share of the fraction of user's `lpAmount` to transfer tokens to users in a loop. This causes multiple tokens to be transfered with the same share ratio multiple times.


## Vulnerability Detail
The issue lies in the `emergencyWithdraw(...)` function and the main issue is that the `lpAmount` is used to calculate the amount transferred to the user in a loop. This causes the `lpAmount` fraction of the all assets in the pool to be transferred to the user.
The following calculation is supposed to be done and transferred just once but because it is in a loop, all other tokens are calculated and sent to the user based on just one `lpAmount`  for the whole pool.

```solidity
for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokens.length; i++) {
            if (amounts[i] == 0) {
                if (minAmounts[i] != 0) revert InsufficientAmount();
                continue;
            }
            uint256 amount = FullMath.mulDiv(
                IERC20(tokens[i]).balanceOf(address(this)),
                request.lpAmount,
                totalSupply
            );
            if (amount < minAmounts[i]) revert InsufficientAmount();
            IERC20(tokens[i]).safeTransfer(request.to, amount);
            actualAmounts[i] = amount;
        }

```
Here is the full `emergencyWithdraw(...)` function

```solidity
function emergencyWithdraw(
        uint256[] memory minAmounts,
        uint256 deadline
    )
        external
        nonReentrant
        checkDeadline(deadline)
        returns (uint256[] memory actualAmounts)
    {
        uint256 timestamp = block.timestamp;
        address sender = msg.sender;
        if (!_pendingWithdrawers.contains(sender)) revert InvalidState();
        WithdrawalRequest memory request = _withdrawalRequest[sender];
        if (timestamp > request.deadline) {
            _cancelWithdrawalRequest(sender);
            return actualAmounts;
        }

        if (
            request.timestamp + configurator.emergencyWithdrawalDelay() >
            timestamp
        ) revert InvalidState();

        uint256 totalSupply = totalSupply();
        (address[] memory tokens, uint256[] memory amounts) = baseTvl();
        if (minAmounts.length != tokens.length) revert InvalidLength();
        actualAmounts = new uint256[](tokens.length);
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokens.length; i++) {
            if (amounts[i] == 0) {
                if (minAmounts[i] != 0) revert InsufficientAmount();
                continue;
            }
            uint256 amount = FullMath.mulDiv(
                IERC20(tokens[i]).balanceOf(address(this)),
                request.lpAmount,
                totalSupply
            );
            if (amount < minAmounts[i]) revert InsufficientAmount();
            IERC20(tokens[i]).safeTransfer(request.to, amount);
            actualAmounts[i] = amount;
        }
        delete _withdrawalRequest[sender];
        _pendingWithdrawers.remove(sender);
        _burn(address(this), request.lpAmount);
        emit EmergencyWithdrawal(sender, request, actualAmounts);
    }
```


## Impact
Malicious users can use the `emergencyWithdraw(...)` function to withdraw more than they deposited causing losses to other depositors

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider using the ratios  that were used in deposit to get the `lpAmount` to give fraction of asset relating to the fraction of `lpAmount`
