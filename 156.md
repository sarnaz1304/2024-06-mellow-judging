## Summary
Missing the call `ManagedRatiosOracle.sol::updateRatios` can lead to out-of-sync token ratios therefore creating a DoS

## Vulnerability Detail
`ManagedRatiosOracle.sol::getTargetRatiosX96()` takes the `address vault` as an argument to get the per-token ratio allocation according to the underlying tokens of the token. To make sure that the price oracle fetcher action goes through, it needs to match it with the stored hash of the token in the oracle and hash of the underlying token for the respective vault. 

## Impact
Missing in updating the vaultData mapping to the vault when the underlying token allocation changes or gets removed can lead to reverting for fetching the ratio of the token data thus leading DoS primarily for deposits and withdrawals

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Making an admin controlled off-chain event request for updating the oracles
