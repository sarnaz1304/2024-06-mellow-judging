# Not correct underlyingAmount in `DefaultBondTvlModule` contract

## Summary
Data struct in `DefaultBondTvlModule` has not correct underlyingAmount. It can be manipualated by the attacker

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `DefaultBondTvlModule::tvl` we count total value locked for two different tokens: token = `bonds[i]`, and underlyingToken = `IBond(bonds[i]).asset()`. Even though those tokens seems to have 1:1 ratio, we count token amount as `IERC20(bonds[i]).balanceOf(vault)`, and underlyingToken amount as `data[i].amount`. This implies that token amount and underlyingToken amount will always be the same. But because we use ERC20 `balanceOf` function to count the amount, attacker can send either `token` or `underlyingToken` to the vault, so that the ratio of total locked amounts will no be 1:1 anymore

## Impact
Will not count real total value locked correctly

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use instead of `data[i].underlyingAmount = data[i].amount` - `data[i].underlyingAmount = IERC20(bonds[i].asset()).balanceOf(vault)`
