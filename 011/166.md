# Withdrawal fee not applied to emergencyWithdraw

## Summary
The withdrawal fee is not applied to `emergencyWithdraw`.

## Vulnerability Detail
In VaultConfigurator, `withdrawalFeeD9` is applied when processing withdrawals. This fee however is only applied during `processWithdrawals` and not applied for `emergencyWithdraw`.
```solidity
function analyzeRequest(
        ProcessWithdrawalsStack memory s,
        WithdrawalRequest memory request
    ) public pure returns (bool, bool, uint256[] memory expectedAmounts) {
        ...
        uint256 value = FullMath.mulDiv(lpAmount, s.totalValue, s.totalSupply);
        value = FullMath.mulDiv(value, D9 - s.feeD9, D9); //@audit only done during processWithdrawals
        ...
```
## Impact
Protocol loses revenue from fees whenever users withdraw using `emergencyWithdraw`.
