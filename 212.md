# `Vault::processWithdrawals` counts not correct withdrawal amount for withdrawal requests

## Summary
`Vault::processWithdrawals` counts not correct withdrawal amount for withdrawal requests because after each withdrawal request, it does not update `s.totalValue`, `s.totalSupply` variables.

## Vulnerability Detail
So `Vault::processWithdrawals` has an array of withdrawal requests that are executed in one transaction in the loop. In order to count the amount to withdraw, we use total value and total supply. It is counted only once inside `calculateStack` function and used inside `analyzeRequest` function to count the amount to withdraw and a fee amount:
```solidity
        uint256 value = FullMath.mulDiv(lpAmount, s.totalValue, s.totalSupply);
        value = FullMath.mulDiv(value, D9 - s.feeD9, D9);
```
After each withdrawal they update `s.erc20Balances` variable, but do not update `s.totalValue`, `s.totalSupply` variables. But those amounts are changed after each withdrawal. So it should be updated to count each next withdrawal amount correctly. At least in this formula there could a rounding so that it will change a little a ratio of s.totalValue and s.totalSupply:
```solidity
        uint256 value = FullMath.mulDiv(lpAmount, s.totalValue, s.totalSupply);
```

Also fees amount can be affected for next withdrawals in the loop

## Impact
Not correct withdrawal amounts counted in the processWithdrawals function

## Recommendation
Update `s.totalValue`, `s.totalSupply` variables after each withdraw inside `Vault::processWithdrawals`
