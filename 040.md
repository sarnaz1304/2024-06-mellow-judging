# Malicious actor can frontrun the stEth price change to get unfair advantage

## Summary
Malicious actor can frontrun the stEth price change to get unfair advantage by monitoring mempool for slashing/penalty event

## Vulnerability Detail
Protocol takes stEth/wstEth as deposit and mints lpToken to user. Now this is a problem because change in price of stEth due to slashing event can be predicted earlier.
```solidity
whitelisted tokens:
eth
weth - https://etherscan.io/token/0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2
steth - https://etherscan.io/token/0xae7ab96520de3a18e5e111b5eaab095312d7fe84
wsteth - https://etherscan.io/token/0x7f39c581f595b53c5cb19bd0b3f8da6c935e2ca0
```

A malicious actor can deposit stEth before price drop and gets lpToken and withdraw them as soon as price drops, receiving more stEth than deposited earlier.
Reasons for possible price drop can be:
1. Slashing
2. Lower demand
3. Withdrawal of big rewards


## Impact
Loss for the protocol and mellow users

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
When a user makes a deposit wait for some time before minting lpToken, so that oracle updates the price change
