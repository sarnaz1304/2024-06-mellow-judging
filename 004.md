# Missing Check in `addToken()` Function Allows Withdrawal of Additional Tokens

## Summary
The `Vault::addToken()` function is missing a check to prevent adding another underlying token address if users have deposit assets to this vault.
Calling `addToken()` to add new underlying token can lead to existing users withdraw additional tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `Vault::addToken()` function allows adding new underlying tokens to a vault. However, it lacks a critical check to prevent the addition of a new underlying token address when users have already deposited assets into the vault, leading to users who deposited assets before the addition of the new underlying token can withdraw tokens of the newly added underlying token, even though they did not deposit any of these new tokens.

## Impact
Unfair withdrawal  of tokens.
