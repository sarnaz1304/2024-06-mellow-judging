# Users can arbitrage assets into a vault despite the presence of a withdrawal queue

## Summary
The withdrawal queue do not prevent malicious users to deposit and withdraw in the same block, opening-up possibilities for arbitrage.

## Vulnerability Detail
In order to limit arbitrage of the different assets of the vault, Mellow has implemented a withdrawal queue as it is common practice.

Each user can only have one withdrawal request at a time, which is stored inside a mapping at `_withdrawalRequest[sender]`
If a user has created a withdrawal request, its address gets addd to the `_pendingWithdrawers` set.
Then, operators can process users request by calling `processWithdrawals(address[] memory users)` with the array of users they want to process the requests.

This system should logically prevent a user to withdraw in the same block as a deposit, or at least make it really unlikely as the operator (which is trusted) must send the tx to process the request of the user in the same block, after the withdrawal request tx.

But there a way for a malicious user (Bob) to easily get around that protection following these steps:
1. Bob deposit some funds into the vault (the amount to deposit isn't important, can be the minimum required)
2. Bob create withdrawal requests regularly so that his address is always present in the queue (the value to withdraw isn't important, can be very low). Because the request is in the queue, there's chances that the operator will process it.
3. Bob listen to the mempool and see there is an opportunity to arbitrage the vault at the same time that the operator decided to process its waiting request with Bob's address in the input array of `processWithdrawals(address[] memory users)`
4. Bob front-run the operator and cancels its previous request 
5. Still front-running, he deposit a large amount of funds to increase the profitability of the operation
6. still front-running, he create a new withdrawal request for the deposit he made in (5)
7. the operator tx is executed with Bob's address

Bob was able to deposit and withdraw in a same block and profit from a price change, also avoiding risk of slashing for LRT vaults like wstETH

Please note that this is even easier for vaults using the defaultBondStrategy[ as there is a `processAll()` function](https://github.com/mellow-finance/mellow-lrt/blob/8191087682cc6a7f36c1c6390e37eb308953b11a/src/strategies/DefaultBondStrategy.sol#L84), in this case there is no need to keep a request alive in the queue

## Impact
Users can circumvent the withdrawal queue and deposit>withdraw in the same block, opening possibilities for arbitrage

## Code Snippet

The function analyzeRequest perform sanity checks against deadline and amounts to be withdrawn:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-mellow/blob/main/mellow-lrt/src/Vault.sol#L536
```solidity
File: src/Vault.sol
536:     function processWithdrawals(
537:         address[] memory users
538:     ) external nonReentrant returns (bool[] memory statuses) {
539:         _requireAtLeastOperator();
540:         statuses = new bool[](users.length);
541:         ProcessWithdrawalsStack memory s = calculateStack();
542:         uint256 burningSupply = 0;
543:         for (uint256 i = 0; i < users.length; i++) {
544:             address user = users[i];
545:             if (!_pendingWithdrawers.contains(user)) continue;
546:             WithdrawalRequest memory request = _withdrawalRequest[user];
547:             (
548:                 bool isProcessingPossible,
549:                 bool isWithdrawalPossible,
550:                 uint256[] memory expectedAmounts
551:⚠>>		 ) = analyzeRequest(s, request);
552: 
553:             if (!isProcessingPossible) {
554:                 _cancelWithdrawalRequest(user);
555:                 continue;
556:             }
557: 
558:             if (!isWithdrawalPossible) continue;
559: 
```

But no check of request timestamp creation against `block.timestamp`, which would prevent such operations:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-mellow/blob/main/mellow-lrt/src/Vault.sol#L482
```solidity
File: src/Vault.sol
476:     function analyzeRequest(
477:         ProcessWithdrawalsStack memory s,
478:         WithdrawalRequest memory request
479:     ) public pure returns (bool, bool, uint256[] memory expectedAmounts) { //* isProcessingPossible, isWithdrawalPossible, expectedAmounts
480:         uint256 lpAmount = request.lpAmount;
481:         if (
482:⚠>>          request.tokensHash != s.tokensHash || request.deadline < s.timestamp
483:         ) return (false, false, expectedAmounts);
```

## Tool used
Manual review

## Recommendation
Check request creation timestamp against `block.timestamp` and act accordingly if equal
