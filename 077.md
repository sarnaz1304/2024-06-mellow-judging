# Storage slot of role-based data is prone to pre-image attacks

## Summary

`ManagedValidator::STORAGE_POSITION` variable represents the slot where the role-based data will be stored, when deploying the validator contract. However slots manually constructed using a string combined with `keccak256` for hashing can be prone to storage slot collision as the hash value is known.

## Vulnerability Detail

```javascript
bytes32 public constant STORAGE_POSITION =
        keccak256("mellow.lrt.permissions.storage");

```

An attacker can find a path to locate this slot by also using the `keccak256` method and some crafted payload

## Impact

- Impact: High, as the pre-image of this hash is known, thus an attacker can exploit it
- Likelihood: Low, as it requires from a malicious actor to locate the slot position
- Overall: Medium

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Subtract by `1`, so that the pre-image would not be easily attainable. For example OpenZeppelin uses that technique for it's proxy contracts.
