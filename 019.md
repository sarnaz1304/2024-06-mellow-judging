# L-5: Unused Custom Error

## Summary

If a custom error is defined but not used in the contract, it is recommended that the definition be removed.

## Vulnerability Detail

Defining custom errors that are not used in the contract can lead to unnecessary complexity and confusion. Unused custom errors increase the contract size and can make the code harder to read and maintain. Removing these unused definitions helps keep the codebase clean and efficient.

## Impact

- Readability: Improves the clarity and simplicity of the code.
- Maintainability: Reduces the effort needed to understand and maintain the contract.
- Contract Size: Minimizes the bytecode size of the contract, which can reduce deployment costs.

## Recommendation

Review your contract to identify any custom errors that are defined but not used. Remove these unused custom errors to improve the readability, maintainability, and efficiency of your contract.
