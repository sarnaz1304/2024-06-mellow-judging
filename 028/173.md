# Potential Addition of Invalid Aggregator Entries in setChainlinkOracles Function

## Summary
The `setChainlinkOracles` function updates `Chainlink` oracle data for a vault by setting token-to-aggregator mappings. However, the function currently allows entries with aggregatorV3 set to address(0) to be added to the _aggregatorsData mapping. This occurs because the validation loop skips these entries without validating them, while the subsequent loop adds all entries, including those with aggregatorV3 set to address(0). This discrepancy can lead to the addition of invalid or undesired entries in the _aggregatorsData mapping.
## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability arises from the inconsistency between the validation and mapping update logic in the setChainlinkOracles function. The function performs the following steps:

Validation Loop: It iterates over the tokens array, skipping entries where data_[i].aggregatorV3 is address(0) and validating the rest.

```solidity
for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokens.length; i++) {
    if (data_[i].aggregatorV3 == address(0)) continue;
    _validateAndGetPrice(data_[i]);
}
```
Mapping Update Loop: It iterates over the tokens array again, adding all entries to the _aggregatorsData mapping, including those with aggregatorV3 set to address(0).
```solidity 
for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokens.length; i++) {
    _aggregatorsData[vault][tokens[i]] = data_[i];
}

```
This means that entries with aggregatorV3 set to address(0) are not validated but are still added to the mapping, which can lead to invalid entries in the _aggregatorsData mapping.

## Impact
Invalid Entries: The _aggregatorsData mapping may contain entries with aggregatorV3 set to address(0), which are likely invalid and undesired.
Inconsistent Data: The presence of invalid entries in the mapping can lead to inconsistencies and potential errors in subsequent operations that rely on this data.
Security Risks: If the _aggregatorsData mapping is used in critical operations, such as price feeds for financial transactions, invalid entries can pose security risks and financial discrepancies.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-mellow/blob/main/mellow-lrt/src/oracles/ChainlinkOracle.sol#L45

```solidity 
    function setChainlinkOracles(
        address vault,
        address[] calldata tokens,
        AggregatorData[] calldata data_
    ) external {
        IDefaultAccessControl(vault).requireAdmin(msg.sender);
        if (tokens.length != data_.length) revert InvalidLength();
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokens.length; i++) {
            if (data_[i].aggregatorV3 == address(0)) continue;
            _validateAndGetPrice(data_[i]);
        }
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokens.length; i++) {
            _aggregatorsData[vault][tokens[i]] = data_[i];
        }
        emit ChainlinkOracleSetChainlinkOracles(
            vault,
            tokens,
            data_,
            block.timestamp
        );
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add the same validation check in the second loop to ensure that entries with aggregatorV3 set to address(0) are not added to the _aggregatorsData mapping. Here is the corrected function:

```diff
function setChainlinkOracles(
    address vault,
    address[] calldata tokens,
    AggregatorData[] calldata data_
) external {
    IDefaultAccessControl(vault).requireAdmin(msg.sender);
    if (tokens.length != data_.length) revert InvalidLength();

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokens.length; i++) {
        if (data_[i].aggregatorV3 == address(0)) continue;
        _validateAndGetPrice(data_[i]);
    }

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokens.length; i++) {
+       if (data_[i].aggregatorV3 == address(0)) continue;
        _aggregatorsData[vault][tokens[i]] = data_[i];
    }

    emit ChainlinkOracleSetChainlinkOracles(
        vault,
        tokens,
        data_,
        block.timestamp
    );
}
```
