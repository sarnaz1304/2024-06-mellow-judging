# Potential DOS in removeToken Function

## Summary
The `removeToken` function can be front-run to prevent token removal, potentially leading to a Denial of Service (DOS) condition.


## Vulnerability Detail
The `removeToken` function checks if the token balance is zero before removing it. An attacker could monitor the mempool for `removeToken` transactions and front-run them with a small deposit, causing the removal to fail.

## Impact
This vulnerability could prevent administrators from managing the list of underlying tokens effectively, potentially disrupting protocol operations.


## Code Snippet
```solidity
function removeToken(address token) external nonReentrant {
    _requireAdmin();
    if (!_isUnderlyingToken[token]) revert InvalidToken();
    (address[] memory tokens, uint256[] memory amounts) = underlyingTvl();
    uint256 index = tokens.length;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokens.length; i++) {
        if (tokens[i] == token) {
            if (amounts[i] != 0) revert NonZeroValue();
            index = i;
            break;
        }
    }
    // ... (code omitted for brevity)
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Instead of requiring a zero balance, implement a time-delayed removal process or allow removal of tokens with non-zero balances, transferring the remaining tokens to a designated address.
