# Removeal of underlying tokens can be DoS'd

## Summary
The `removeToken(...)` is used to removed an underlying token from the vault. The protocol applies a safety measure to ensure that an underlying token that currently adds up to the tvl does not get removed does not get removed preventing users from withdrawing or even miscalculation of TVLs.
However, the safety check can be used by a malicious user to cause the a Denial of Service causing the `removeToken(...)` to revert 


```solidity
File: Vault.sol

205:     function removeToken(address token) external nonReentrant {
206:         _requireAdmin();
207:         if (!_isUnderlyingToken[token]) revert InvalidToken();
208: @>      (address[] memory tokens, uint256[] memory amounts) = underlyingTvl();
209:         uint256 index = tokens.length;
210:         for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokens.length; i++) {
211:             if (tokens[i] == token) {
212: @>              if (amounts[i] != 0) revert NonZeroValue();
213:                 index = i;
214:                 break;
215:             }
216:         }
SNIP
......
223:         emit TokenRemoved(token);
224:     }


```

The problem is that 
- the function will revert provided there is no amount of the underlying token to remove is not zero as shown in `L212` above
- the tvl can be manipulated because it is calculated off of the token's balance in the vault as shown below in some of the tvl modules
```solidity
File: ERC20TvlModule.sol
17:             data[i].amount = IERC20(tokens[i]).balanceOf(vault);

File: DefaultBondTvlModule.sol
35:             data[i].amount = IERC20(bonds[i]).balanceOf(vault);


```


## Vulnerability Detail
Hence 
- a malicious user can frontrun the `removeToken(...)` call with the `deposit(...)` function call to deposit the underlying token that the admin wants to remove so that the call will revert on `L212`
- because users cannot be forced to request withdraws, they can purposely leave behind dust amounts in the protocol

## Impact
underlying token removal can be DOS'd preventing protocol from removing tokens from the vault

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider reimplementing the `removeToken(...)` to ensure even dust amounts cannot be used to spam removals of underlying tokens
