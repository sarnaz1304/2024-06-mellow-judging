# [M-1] Frontrunning `Vault::removeToken` function to prevent the admin from removing tokens.

## Summary
The `Vault::removeToken` function checks if the balance of the underlying token before removing it, and if the balance `!= 0` the transaction will revert.

## Vulnerability Detail
A user can see the `removeToken` transaction in the mempool and frontrun it, by sending a small amount of tokens back into the `Vault` contract in order to make the transaction revert all the time.

## Impact
The admin is not able to remove tokens.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function removeToken(address token) external nonReentrant {
//..
//..
            if (tokens[i] == token) {
//@audit | this will revert here, as the balance will not be zero
>               if (amounts[i] != 0) revert NonZeroValue();
                index = i;
                break;
            }
        }
//..
//..
    
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Doing a "sweep" before removing a token or sending the remaining tokens from the `Vault` to a "safe address" will solve the issue. An example of a possible approach below.

```diff
    function removeToken(address token) external nonReentrant {
//..
//..
            if (tokens[i] == token) {
                if (amounts[i] != 0) {
+               uint256 remainder = //calculate balance of of vault for this token;
+               safeTransfer(address(this), //some safe address, remainder);
}
                index = i;
                break;
            }
        }
//..
//..
    
```
