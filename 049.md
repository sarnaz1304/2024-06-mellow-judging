# arbitrage using chainlink  price deivations

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
mellow protocol uses steth to mint mLrt tokens. The value of stETH deposited into the protocol is priced using chainlink oracle. The current deviation and heartbeat of stETH/ETH are`` 0.5% and 86400s.`` This means stETH price will not be updated it the price doesn't deviate 0.5% in 24 hours. This difference between market price and oracle price can be used to perform arbitrage.
POC:
-    Deposit stETH before the Depeg (front-run oracle update)
-   Get mLRT
-    Withdraw stETH after the depeg for profit.
## Impact
Attacker can make profit using arbitrage opportunity.
