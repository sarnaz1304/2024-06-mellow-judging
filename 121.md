# `!isProcessingPossible` case inside `processWithdrawals` canceling user withdrawal request can cause issues

## Summary
External factor like vault state and price variation can cause a user withdrawal request to be canceled if his request is processed at the same time, forcing him to create a new request, resetting his emergency withdrawal request timer to zero.

## Vulnerability Detail
User who have deposited into a vault can chose to withdraw their assets and the earned yield by calling `registerWithdrawal`, which will create add their request to a withdrawal queue. The withdrawal request can then be processed either by an Operator through `processWithdrawals`, or through `emergencyWithdrawal` by the user who created the request once the `emergencyWithdrawalDelay` has passed.

When registering a withdrawal, the user can set `request.minAmounts` the minimum of amount of asset he expect to get through the process. **This amount will depend then of the state of the vault and the price of the assets at the time the withdrawal is processed**, by the computation of the `ratioX96Value`.

During `processWithdrawals`, `analyzeRequest` will compare `expectedAmounts` (the amount that will be sent to user) to `request.minAmounts`, and will return `isProcessingPossible = false` when `expectedAmounts > request.minAmounts`

The issue here is that when this happens, the user request is [automatically canceled](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-mellow/blob/main/mellow-lrt/src/Vault.sol#L554-L554), which simply delete the request from the queue, meaning user will have to create a fresh new request.
Because the user will have to create a new request, all the time that has passed since creation, and would have allowed him to call `emergencyWithdraw` himself, will be reset to 0 without his consent or his knowledge.
The user will then have to go through the whole delay once again, and will still risk the same event as the vault state and asset price cannot be predicted.

## Impact
User can see their right to call `emergencyWithdraw` reset to zero because of fluctuating prices and vault state which is out of their control. 
Because the timer is reset, they might be subject to unfair risk event that could have been avoided if the timer was not reset on their behalf.

```solidity
File: src/Vault.sol
536:     function processWithdrawals(
537:         address[] memory users
538:     ) external nonReentrant returns (bool[] memory statuses) {
539:         _requireAtLeastOperator();
540:         statuses = new bool[](users.length);
541:         ProcessWithdrawalsStack memory s = calculateStack();
542:         uint256 burningSupply = 0;
543:         for (uint256 i = 0; i < users.length; i++) {
544:             address user = users[i];
545:             if (!_pendingWithdrawers.contains(user)) continue;
546:             WithdrawalRequest memory request = _withdrawalRequest[user];
547:             (
548:                 bool isProcessingPossible,
549:                 bool isWithdrawalPossible,
550:                 uint256[] memory expectedAmounts
551:             ) = analyzeRequest(s, request);
552: 
553:             if (!isProcessingPossible) {
554:âš 				 _cancelWithdrawalRequest(user);
555:				 continue;
556:             }
```

## Tool used
Manual review

## Recommendation
Do not cancel the withdrawal request when `isProcessingPossible = false`
It may be better to make the request cancelable by the operator based on its age.
