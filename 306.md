# `_requireAtLeastOperator()` is implemented wrongly breaking core protocol functionality

## Summary
The `_requireAtLeastOperator()` function is used exclusively to protect most privilege functions in the protocol. It is intended to ensure that only a caller that admin role or at least an operator role can call the functions that is protects.

As shown below, it check to ensure that the caller has both the admin and operator roles.
```solidity
File: DefaultAccessControl.sol
53:     function _requireAtLeastOperator(address sender) internal view {
54: @>      if (!isAdmin(sender) && !isOperator(sender)) revert Forbidden();
55:     }

```

## Vulnerability Detail
Assume for instance that
- Sam has both `OPERATOR` and `ADMIN_ROLE` roles respectively.
- Bob has `ADMIN_ROLE` role.
- Alice has `OPERATOR` role.

If 
- Alice calls `Vault::processWithdrawals(...)` it will revert because, although she is an operator but she is not also an admin
- Bob calls `Vault::processWithdrawals(...)` it will revert because, although he is an admin but he is not also an operator
- Sam calls `Vault::processWithdrawals(...)` it will not revert because he is both an admin and an operator


So the goal of giving access to an account that has at least an `OPERATOR` role is defeated

## Impact
The implementation breaks core protocol functionality

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Modify the `_requireAtLeastOperator()` function as shown below


```solidity
File: DefaultAccessControl.sol
53:     function _requireAtLeastOperator(address sender) internal view {

54: -       if (!isAdmin(sender) && !isOperator(sender)) revert Forbidden();
54: +       if (!isAdmin(sender) || !isOperator(sender)) revert Forbidden();

55:     }

```
