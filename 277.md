# `ADMIN_ROLE`, `ADMIN_DELEGATE_ROLE`, and `OPERATOR` roles at risk

## Summary
`ADMIN_ROLE`, `ADMIN_DELEGATE_ROLE`, and `OPERATOR` roles at risk as `initialize(...)`can be front-run.

## Vulnerability Detail
`ADMIN_ROLE`, `ADMIN_DELEGATE_ROLE`, and `OPERATOR` roles at risk as `initialize(...)`can be front-run since anyone can call `initialize(...)` because of a lack of `_disableInitializers()` in the constructor. `initialize(...)` cannot be called a 2nd time even though `initializer()` modifier is not used, and that's because of the configurator variable that is set when `initialize(...)` is first called by the attacker.

## Impact
All functions that should be only callable by admin or operator can be called by the attacker, the ones calling `_requireAdmin()`and  using the modifiers `atLeastOperator()` and `onlyAdmin()`. The attacker will be able to configure the vault to his liking, add and remove tokens and modules, process withdrawls when he wants and more. He's in complete control of the protocol

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-mellow/blob/main/mellow-lrt/src/security/Initializer.sol#L14
```solidity
constructor()
        ERC20("Initializer", "init")
        DefaultAccessControl(address(this)) // @audit _disableInitializers() ownership at risk
    {}
    
function initialize(
        string memory name_,
        string memory symbol_,
        address admin_
    ) external {
        if (address(configurator) != address(0)) revert();
        configurator = new VaultConfigurator();

        // copy and paste from DefaultAccessControl constructor
        if (admin_ == address(0)) revert AddressZero();
        _grantRole(OPERATOR, admin_);
        _grantRole(ADMIN_ROLE, admin_);

        _setRoleAdmin(ADMIN_ROLE, ADMIN_ROLE);
        _setRoleAdmin(ADMIN_DELEGATE_ROLE, ADMIN_ROLE);
        _setRoleAdmin(OPERATOR, ADMIN_DELEGATE_ROLE);

        // ...
        }
    }
```
## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Fix the bug by adding `_disableInitializers()` to the constructor.
