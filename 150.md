# `DefaultBondStrategy::processAll` can revert due to lack of gas

## Summary
`DefaultBondStrategy::processAll` can revert due to lack of gas and a lot of mixed functionality

## Vulnerability Detail
`DefaultBondStrategy::processAll` calls a lot of nested loops, delegate calls, storage copies, so it seems it could easily lead to the lack of gas error

## Impact
Can revert when more tokens are in the vault
