# Out-of-Bounds Access in `tokens` Array

## Summary
The critical bug arises from the sorting mechanism applied to the `tokens` array within the `baseTvl` function:
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; i++) {
    for (uint256 j = i + 1; j < length; j++) {
        if (tokens[i] < tokens[j]) continue;
        (tokens[i], tokens[j]) = (tokens[j], tokens[i]);
    }
}
```
1. Out-of-Bounds Access: If the tokens array is not fully initialized or if its size (length) exceeds its initial allocation, accessing tokens[i] or tokens[j] where i or j are out of the initialized bounds can occur. This leads to unpredictable behavior or runtime errors like "index out of range" in Solidity.
2. The attacker crafts input data such that the number of unique tokens `(data.length)` retrieved from _tvls() is greater than the actual initialized elements in the `tokens` array.

## Impact
Denial of Service (DoS) Attack:

Scenario: An attacker crafts input data such that the length variable exceeds the actual number of initialized elements in tokens.

Exploitation: During the sorting process, when the loop attempts to access tokens[i] or tokens[j] beyond the initialized bounds, Solidity may throw an exception (invalid opcode), halting contract execution.
Calls `baseTvl` on the `IVulnerableContract`.
Attempts to access an element `(tokens[tokenCount])` beyond the initialized bounds of the tokens array.
This action exploits the out-of-bounds access vulnerability identified in the `baseTvl` function.
Impact: This can lead to a DoS attack where the contract becomes temporarily or permanently unusable. For example, other critical functions relying on baseTvl may fail to execute, disrupting normal operations of the smart contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
nitialization Check: Ensure the tokens array is properly initialized with a length corresponding to the number of unique tokens found in data.

Bounds Checking: Implement rigorous bounds checking within loops to prevent accessing array elements beyond their initialized boundaries.
