# Unintentional user funds loss from inflation attack as the minimum dead shares are weakly enforced

## Summary

The minimum dead shares (LP) can be set to 1 wei by the operator during the initial deposit.

## Vulnerability Detail

The Vault contract has multiple countermeasures to prevent the possibility of an inflation attack on user deposits, but the weak enforcement of the minimum dead shares amount can lead to unintentional user funds loss.

In an unlikely scenario:
1. The operator deposits 2 WSTETH as the initial deposit with `minLpAmount = 1`.
2. Later, Alice deposits 3 WSTETH with `minLpAmount = 1` (maximum possible).
3. Alice will lose the equivalent value of 0.5 WSTETH.

## Impact

While this is a highly unlikely scenario, it can lead to user funds loss.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement a check against a new constant `MIN_NUMBER_OF_DEAD_LP = 10**3` and enforce it during the first deposit:

```diff
    function _processLpAmount(
        address to,
        uint256 depositValue,
        uint256 totalValue,
        uint256 minLpAmount
    ) private returns (uint256 lpAmount) {
        uint256 totalSupply = totalSupply();
        if (totalSupply == 0) {
            // scenario for initial deposit
            _requireAtLeastOperator();
            lpAmount = minLpAmount;
-           if (lpAmount == 0) revert ValueZero();
+           if (lpAmount < MIN_NUMBER_OF_DEAD_LP) revert LpAmountTooLow();
            if (to != address(this)) revert Forbidden();
        }
```
