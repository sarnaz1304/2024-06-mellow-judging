# Users can't request more than one withdrawal at a time

## Summary

The logic of [registerWithdrawal](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-mellow/blob/main/mellow-lrt/src/Vault.sol#L434-L473) is broken whenever a user, who has already requested a withdrawal, requests a new one with the parameter [bool closePrevious](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-mellow/blob/main/mellow-lrt/src/Vault.sol#L440) set to false.

## Vulnerability Detail

Whenever a user wants to request a new withdrawal, they would call the function [registerWithdrawal](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-mellow/blob/main/mellow-lrt/src/Vault.sol#L434-L473), which has many parameters, one of which allows the user to optionally close their previous withdrawal request, and simply open a new one. This can be confirmed via the `NatSpec` of the function in [IVault](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-mellow/blob/main/mellow-lrt/src/interfaces/IVault.sol#L237). However, the code contradicts the statement and reverts if the `msg.sender` has a pending withdrawal, as can be seen here:
```solidity
...
if (_pendingWithdrawers.contains(sender)) {
  if (!closePrevious) revert InvalidState();
  _cancelWithdrawalRequest(sender);
}
...
```
As the boolean is negated in the `if statement` - with a pending withdrawal and `closePrevious == true`, the withdrawal will get cancelled. Whereas if `closePrevious == false`, a revert will occur, even though the user wants to keep their old request and create a new one alongside it. The conclusion is that the user has to close their previous withdrawal, otherwise [registerWithdrawal](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-mellow/blob/main/mellow-lrt/src/Vault.sol#L434-L473) will keep reverting.

<summary>Updated test</summary>

```solidity
    function test_UpdatedRegisterWithdrawalFailsWithInvalidState() external {
        Vault vault = new Vault("Mellow LRT Vault", "mLRT", admin);
        vm.startPrank(admin);
        vault.grantRole(vault.ADMIN_DELEGATE_ROLE(), admin);
        vault.grantRole(vault.OPERATOR(), operator);
        _setUp(vault);
        vm.stopPrank();
        _initialDeposit(vault);

        address depositor = address(bytes20(keccak256("depositor")));
        vm.startPrank(depositor);
        deal(Constants.WSTETH, depositor, 10 ether);
        IERC20(Constants.WSTETH).safeIncreaseAllowance(
            address(vault),
            10 ether
        );
        uint256[] memory amounts = new uint256[](3);
        amounts[0] = 10 ether;
        vault.deposit(depositor, amounts, 10 ether, type(uint256).max);

        // closePrevious won't affect anything here, as there's no pending withdrawal
        vault.registerWithdrawal(
            depositor,
            6 ether,
            new uint256[](3),
            type(uint256).max,
            type(uint256).max,
            true
        );

        // reverts
        vm.expectRevert(abi.encodeWithSignature("InvalidState()"));
        vault.registerWithdrawal(
            depositor,
            2 ether,
            new uint256[](3),
            type(uint256).max,
            type(uint256).max,
            false
        );

        // cancels the first withdrawal and opens a new one
        vault.registerWithdrawal(
            depositor,
            1 ether,
            new uint256[](3),
            type(uint256).max,
            type(uint256).max,
            true
        );

        // reverts as there's a pending withdrawal (leaving no other choice to the user but to cancel it)
        vm.expectRevert(abi.encodeWithSignature("InvalidState()"));
        vault.registerWithdrawal(
            depositor,
            1 ether,
            new uint256[](3),
            type(uint256).max,
            type(uint256).max,
            false
        );
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```

## Impact

Broken functionality of one of the core functions in the Vault contract, making it impossible for users to have more than one withdrawal request.

## Recommendation

Consider implementing the following changes for the desired flow to be achieved:
```diff

-       if (_pendingWithdrawers.contains(sender)) {
+       if (_pendingWithdrawers.contains(sender) && closePrevious) {
-           if (!closePrevious) revert InvalidState();
            _cancelWithdrawalRequest(sender);
        }
```
In addition to that, make sure that the mapping [_withdrawalRequest](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-mellow/blob/main/mellow-lrt/src/Vault.sol#L24) is updated so that it handles multiple withdrawal requests.
