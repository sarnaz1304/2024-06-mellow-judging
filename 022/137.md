# Skipping valid proposals in `acceptProposal` function.

## Summary
The current implementation of the `acceptProposal` function does not account for the scenario where multiple valid proposals exist. It can skip valid proposals. This flaw can result in the inadvertent omission of valid proposals from being accepted and executed.

## Vulnerability Detail
The current implementation of the `acceptProposal` function incorrectly checks the index against the latest accepted nonce. This flawed condition may lead to the rejection of valid proposals with non-consecutive indices, causing them to be overlooked and not processed.

```solidity
function acceptProposal(uint256 index) external onlyAcceptor {
    if (index <= latestAcceptedNonce || _proposals.length < index)
        revert Forbidden();
    Proposal memory proposal = _proposals[index - 1];
    proxyAdmin.upgradeAndCall(
        proxy,
        proposal.implementation,
        proposal.callData
    );
    latestAcceptedNonce = index;
    emit ProposalAccepted(index, tx.origin);
}
```

## Impact
The vulnerability in the `acceptProposal` function can have a significant impact on the contract's functionality and consistency. If there are multiple valid proposals, only the proposal with the highest index will be accepted and executed, while the rest will be ignored. This can lead to missed upgrades, unfixed issues, or the inability to implement desired changes.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
In order to do not skip any proposals, the new proposal index should be equal to `latestAcceptedNonce` + 1.

```solidity
function acceptProposal(uint256 index) external onlyAcceptor {
    if (index != latestAcceptedNonce + 1 || _proposals.length < index)
        revert Forbidden();
    Proposal memory proposal = _proposals[index - 1];
    proxyAdmin.upgradeAndCall(
        proxy,
        proposal.implementation,
        proposal.callData
    );
    latestAcceptedNonce = index;
    emit ProposalAccepted(index, tx.origin);
}
```
