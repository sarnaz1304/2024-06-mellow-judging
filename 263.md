# In the current state the `Vault::deposit` function is incompatible the value used in deployment scripts (which will be used as README states)

## Summary
In the current state the `Vault::deposit` function is incompatible the value used in deployment scripts (which will be used as README states)

## Vulnerability Detail
README of the contest state that :
> Are there any limitations on values set by admins (or other roles) in the codebase, including restrictions on array lengths?
>>Only the parameters from the deployment script below:
>>https://github.com/mellow-finance/mellow-lrt/blob/dev-symbiotic-deploy/scripts/mainnet/Deploy.s.sol#L9

So, we must consider that the `Vault::deposit` function will receive parameters as shown is this file.
What we can see it the deploy file is that at deployment the oracle aggregators [are all set to the zero address](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-mellow/blob/main/mellow-lrt/scripts/mainnet/DeployScript.sol#L20-L35)
Then, after the vault has been initialized, [the initial deposit of the vault is executed](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-mellow/blob/main/mellow-lrt/scripts/mainnet/DeployScript.sol#L315-L320)
The issue here is that the vault will revert because it has to call the price oracle (which is set to address zero) during the process, while this isn't necessary as only the raw `minLpAmount` [which is an input parameter of `Vault::deposit`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-mellow/blob/main/mellow-lrt/src/Vault.sol#L288-L288) is necessary during the initial deposit:

```solidity
File: src/Vault.sol
346:     function _processLpAmount(
347:         address to,
348:         uint256 depositValue,
349:         uint256 totalValue,
350:>>       uint256 minLpAmount
351:     ) private returns (uint256 lpAmount) {
352:         uint256 totalSupply = totalSupply();
353: >>      if (totalSupply == 0) {
354:             // scenario for initial deposit
355:             _requireAtLeastOperator();
356: >>          lpAmount = minLpAmount;
357:             if (lpAmount == 0) revert ValueZero();
358:             if (to != address(this)) revert Forbidden();
359:         } else {
```

It is possible to update the `Vault::deposit` function to make it compatible with the deploy script (see recommandation section)

## Impact
`Vault::deposit` implementation is incompatible with actaul deploy script and will revert

## Code Snippet
See above

## Tool used
Manual review

## Recommendation
Skip all price computations if this is the initial deposit (`totalSupply == 0`) as these value aren't used anyway
