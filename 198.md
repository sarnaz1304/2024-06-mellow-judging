# Unbounded Gas Consumption Due to `EnumerableSet` Usage in `pendingWithdrawers` Function in `Vault` contract

## Summary
The `pendingWithdrawers` function in the `Vault` contract, which utilizes the `EnumerableSet` library, will result in unbounded gas consumption. This vulnerability arises when the set of pending withdrawers grows large, leading to potential denial of service (DoS) attacks. This issue is particularly critical when `pendingWithdrawers` is used in state-changing functions such as `processAll` in the `DefaultBondStrategy` contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `pendingWithdrawers` function in the `Vault` contract returns the entire set of pending withdrawers by copying the entire storage to memory. As noted in the warning in the `EnumerableSet` library, this operation can be extremely gas-intensive. When the set grows large, copying it to memory consumes a significant amount of gas, potentially exceeding the block gas limit. This makes the function uncallable, causing the `processAll` function in the `DefaultBondStrategy` contract to fail. The failure of `processAll` can disrupt the entire withdrawal process, affecting all users of the system.

## Impact
The primary impact of this vulnerability is the potential for a denial of service (DoS) attack. If the set of pending withdrawers grows too large, the gas required to execute the `pendingWithdrawers` function may exceed the block gas limit, rendering the function uncallable. This can prevent users from being able to withdraw their funds, causing significant disruptions to the protocol's operations.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
  /**
     * @dev Return the entire set in an array
     *
     * WARNING: This operation will copy the entire storage to memory, which can be quite expensive. This is designed
     * to mostly be used by view accessors that are queried without any gas fees. Developers should keep in mind that
     * this function has an unbounded cost, and using it as part of a state-changing function may render the function
     * uncallable if the set grows to a point where copying to memory consumes too much gas to fit in a block.

    function values(Bytes32Set storage set) internal view returns (bytes32[] memory) {
        bytes32[] memory store = _values(set._inner);
        bytes32[] memory result;

        /// @solidity memory-safe-assembly
        assembly {
            result := store
        }

        return result;
    }
```
this library is used in vault contract 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-mellow/blob/main/mellow-lrt/src/Vault.sol#L25
 ```solidity 
//Vault contract
    function pendingWithdrawers() external view returns (address[] memory) {
        return _pendingWithdrawers.values();
    }
```
later this function is used by `DefaultBondStratergy` contract 
```solidity
    /// @inheritdoc IDefaultBondStrategy
    function processAll() external {
        _requireAtLeastOperator();
        _processWithdrawals(vault.pendingWithdrawers());
    }

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to avoid returning large sets of data in a single call. Instead, implement pagination or chunking mechanisms that allow retrieving subsets of data in multiple calls. This approach ensures that each call remains within the gas limits and prevents potential DoS attacks
