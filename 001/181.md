# _stethToWsteth method revert, resulting in DoS

## Summary
stEth::safeTransferFrom could transfer 1-2 less way, which could lead to the function revert because the same amount is passed into the _stethToWsteth method.

## Vulnerability Detail
**DepositWrapper.sol**

```solidity
if (token == steth) {
IERC20(steth).safeTransferFrom(sender, wrapper, amount);
amount = _stethToWsteth(amount);
```
