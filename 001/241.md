# Protocol supports `stETH`  but doesn't consider its unique transfer logic which would lead to overvaluation of deposited assets

## Summary
The `StakingModule` contract handles staking operations by converting `weth` to `stETH` and `wstETH`. However, a subtle issue arises from the "1-2 wei corner case" with `stETH` transfers, where the amount transferred can be slightly less than specified. This discrepancy can lead to overvaluation of deposited assets and flawed logic in subsequent operations.
## Vulnerability Detail
The core issue lies in the `_wethToWSteth` function, which does not account for the exact amount of `stETH` received after converting `weth`. Due to a known "1-2 wei corner case" in `stETH` transfers, the actual amount received can be less than expected, causing miscalculations in asset values. This leads to an overvaluation of deposited `stETH` when passed into other functions that rely on exact amounts.
For added context/ reference, take a look at:

- https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-dao/issues/442

## Impact
This discrepancy can cause several issues:

- Overvaluation: The protocol may overvalue the deposited assets, leading to imprecise calculations in various staking and withdrawal operations.
- Boost Logic Flaws: If the protocol allows boosting based on deposited amounts, the overvaluation could allow users to boost more than they should be able to, leading to potential financial imbalances.

## Code Snippet
The current implementation of `_wethToWSteth` does not handle the exact amount of `stETH` received:

## Tool used

Manual Review
## Recommendation
To mitigate this issue, modify `_wethToWSteth` to check and use the exact amount of stETH received:
```Solidity
function _wethToWSteth(uint256 amount) private {
    IWeth(weth).withdraw(amount);
    
    uint256 initialStethBalance = IERC20(steth).balanceOf(address(this));
    ISteth(steth).submit{value: amount}(address(0));
    uint256 receivedSteth = IERC20(steth).balanceOf(address(this)) - initialStethBalance;
    
    IERC20(steth).safeIncreaseAllowance(address(wsteth), receivedSteth);
    IWSteth(wsteth).wrap(receivedSteth);
}
```
