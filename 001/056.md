# stETH.transferFrom will transfer 1~2 wei less than the amount specified, leading to reverted transactions

## Summary
When the `DepositWrapper.deposit` function is called, the stETH token is transferred to the contract using the `transferFrom` function.
The transferred amount of `stETH` tokens from the sender may be 1-2 wei less than the amount due to [rounding error](https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-dao/issues/442).
However, the `_stethToWsteth` function uses the originally specified amount instead of the actual transferred amount.
This discrepancy can lead to reverted transactions because of not enough amount.

## Vulnerability Detail
The issue of the account's stETH balance getting lower was reported here: https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-dao/issues/442
stETH is using shares for tracking balances and it is a known issue that due to rounding error, transferred shares may be 1-2 wei less than _amount passed.
So when calling the wrap function, the [revert](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-mellow/blob/main/mellow-lrt/src/utils/DepositWrapper.sol#L37) will happen because the stETH balance is lower than the amount passed.
```solidity
    function _stethToWsteth(uint256 amount) private returns (uint256) {
        IERC20(steth).safeIncreaseAllowance(wsteth, amount);
        IWSteth(wsteth).wrap(amount);
        return IERC20(wsteth).balanceOf(address(this));
    }
```
## Impact
the deposit function may revert if the deposit token is not `wstETH`.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use Lido's recommendation to utilize the `transferShares` function so the `_amount` is accurate, or implement FoT approach, which compares the balance before and after the transfer to determine the actual transferred amount.
