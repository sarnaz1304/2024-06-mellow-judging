# `stEth` deposits will result in a revert

## Summary
The protocol assumes that the amount of tokens received is equal to the amount of tokens transferred.
This is not the case for the `stETH` token.

## Vulnerability Detail
`stETH` is a special token when it comes to its transfer logic and it is known that the amount it transfers is 1-2 wei less than the amount specified in the transfer function. More can be read on the "1-2 wei corner case" issue [here](https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-dao/issues/442). 
Mellow deals with this token in `DepositWrapper: deposit()`:
```solidity
    if (token == steth) {
        IERC20(steth).safeTransferFrom(sender, wrapper, amount);
        amount = _stethToWsteth(amount);
```
After transfering the token it calls `_stethToWsteth()` which will revert:
```solidity
    function _stethToWsteth(uint256 amount) private returns (uint256) {
        IERC20(steth).safeIncreaseAllowance(wsteth, amount);
        IWSteth(wsteth).wrap(amount);
        return IERC20(wsteth).balanceOf(address(this));
    }
```
The reason for the revert is that an `amount - 1` will be transfered and there won't be enough `stETH` in the contract to call `wrap()`.

## Impact
DOS for `stETH` deposits. This issue has also been considered high in previous [contests](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-sophon-judging/issues/63).

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The simplest way to mitigate this issue is to check how much has been transfered:
```diff
    if (token == steth) {
+      uint256 balanceBefore = IERC20(steth).balanceOf(address(this));
       IERC20(steth).safeTransferFrom(sender, wrapper, amount);
+      uint256 receivedAmount =  (IERC20(steth).balanceOf(address(this)) - balanceBefore);     
-      amount = _stethToWsteth(amount); 
+      amount = _stethToWsteth(receivedAmount); 
```
