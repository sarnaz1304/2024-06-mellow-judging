# Incorrect assumption about stETH transferred amount causes reverts in DepositWrapper.sol

## Summary
In `DepositWrapper.sol::deposit()` the protocol incorrectly assumes the amount received in stETH transfer is the same as the amount sent by the user, which causes the function to revert.

## Vulnerability Detail
When transferring stETH like an ERC20 token, the amount received may be a few wei less than what was intended. This behavior is known ([1-2 wei corner case](https://docs.lido.fi/guides/lido-tokens-integration-guide#1-2-wei-corner-case)).
DepositWrapper.sol::deposit() function doesn't consider this and could encounter problems because of it. For example, a user deposits `amount` of stETH. The contract transfers the `amount` from user and attempts to wrap the same `amount` to wstETH which reverts in [_stethToWsteth()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-mellow/blob/main/mellow-lrt/src/utils/DepositWrapper.sol#L35-L39) function due to not having enough balance.
```solidity
function deposit(
        address to,
        address token,
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 minLpAmount,
        uint256 deadline
    ) external payable returns (uint256 lpAmount) {
        . . .
        if (token == steth) {
            IERC20(steth).safeTransferFrom(sender, wrapper, amount);
            amount = _stethToWsteth(amount);
        . . .
        }

function _stethToWsteth(uint256 amount) private returns (uint256) {
        IERC20(steth).safeIncreaseAllowance(wsteth, amount);
        IWSteth(wsteth).wrap(amount);
        return IERC20(wsteth).balanceOf(address(this));
    }
```

## Impact
The function reverts when users try to deposit stETH

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Compare contract's balance before and after the transfer and use the difference as receivedAmount, or use stETH.transferSharesFrom() function instead.
