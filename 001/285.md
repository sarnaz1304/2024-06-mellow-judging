# The `_wethToWSteth` function in the `StakingModule`  is not handling the conversion properly, leading to potential reverts. and loss of funds

## Summary
The `_wethToWSteth` function in the `StakingModule` contract is responsible for converting the `wETH` balance of the Vault to `wstETH`. However, there is an edge case that is not handled properly, leading to potential reverts.

## Vulnerability Detail
Within the `StakingModule` contract, the `_wethToWSteth` function is called by the `convert` and `convertAndDeposit` functions. The issue lies in the way the conversion from `wETH` to `wstETH` is handled, which can result in multiple reverts.

The `_wethToWSteth` function assumes a 1:1 conversion rate between the submitted `ETH` amount and the received `stETH`. However, according to the Lido documentation, in rare cases, this 1:1 ratio may not be preserved. There are two key points:

- The conversion ratio can decrease or decrease (if it decreases -> reverts) (if it increases -> permenant freeze of the extra `stETH` in `Vault`
- Although the probability is low, the impact on the end-user can be significant.


If the conversion ratio deviates from 1:1, the contract will not function correctly, preventing the conversion of `wETH` to `wstETH`. Consequently, the sortedGuardian will not be able to `depositBufferedEther`, leaving the entire contract in a non-functioning state until the conversion ratio returns to 1:1.

## Impact
High

The impact of this vulnerability is considered high, although the probability of occurrence is low. This contract is designed to convert `wETH` to `wstETH` and then `depositBufferedEther`. However, if the conversion ratio deviates from 1:1, all these operations will become non-functional.

giving the consideration of the potential loss of funds when 1 `ETH` gives more `stETH`

            IERC20(wsteth).safeTransferFrom(sender, wrapper, amount);
        } else revert InvalidToken();

        IERC20(wsteth).safeIncreaseAllowance(address(vault), amount);
        uint256[] memory amounts = new uint256[](1);
        amounts[0] = amount;
        (, lpAmount) = vault.deposit(to, amounts, minLpAmount, deadline);
        uint256 balance = IERC20(wsteth).balanceOf(wrapper);
        if (balance > 0) IERC20(wsteth).safeTransfer(sender, balance);
        emit DepositWrapperDeposit(sender, token, amount, lpAmount, deadline);
    }

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Instead of assuming a 1:1 conversion rate, the recommended solution is to retrieve the actual `stETH` balance after the `submit` call and use that `balance` for the subsequent `safeIncreaseAllowance` and `wrap` operations. This approach ensures that the conversion is handled correctly, even in cases where the 1:1 ratio is not preserved.
