# stEth:transferFrom() transfers 1-2 wei less than the actual amount

## Summary
stEth:transferFrom() transfers 1-2 wei less than the actual amount due to rounding down. [Read more](https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-dao/issues/442)

## Vulnerability Detail
When a user deposits stEth using Vault::deposit(), it transfers the actualAmount from user to address(this) using safeTransferFrom()
```solidity
           IERC20(tokens[i]).safeTransferFrom(
                msg.sender,
                address(this),
                amount
            );
            actualAmounts[i] = amount;
```
stETH uses shares for tracking balances and it is a known issue that due to rounding error, transferred shares may be 1-2 wei less than amount passed in transferFrom().

Now the problem is this actualAmount is directly passed to depositCallback(), as result this call will revert or not work as intended because there is 1-2 wei less stEth than actualAmount
```solidity
        address callback = configurator.depositCallback();
        if (callback == address(0)) return (actualAmounts, lpAmount);
   @>     IDepositCallback(callback).depositCallback(actualAmounts, lpAmount);
```

## Impact
Deposit can be DoS

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check balance before and after calling safeTransferFrom() for actual amount transfered
