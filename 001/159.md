# Wrong amount used in `_stethToWsteth` would cause revert due to stEth's 1-2 wei less edge case.

## Summary
When using `DepositWrapper.sol#deposit()` , the function uses same `amount` variable passed down by User in subsequent calculations which would cause revert . 
## Vulnerability Detail
When a User calls `DepositWrapper.sol#deposit()`  , he passes `amount` , `token` & other important parameters as shown below: 
```solidity
function deposit(
        address to,
        address token,
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 minLpAmount,
        uint256 deadline
    ) external payable returns (uint256 lpAmount) {
```

When the token is set to `steth` , first the function transfers the funds from User to the `DepositWrapper.sol` contract using the `amount` parameter passed down by User . The problem occurs when the same `amount` value is passed down to `_stethToWsteth` function as shown below : 

```solidity
  if (token == steth) {
            IERC20(steth).safeTransferFrom(sender, wrapper, amount);
            amount = _stethToWsteth(amount);
        }
```
also `_stethToWsteth` function : 
```solidity
  function _stethToWsteth(uint256 amount) private returns (uint256) {
        IERC20(steth).safeIncreaseAllowance(wsteth, amount);
        IWSteth(wsteth).wrap(amount);
        return IERC20(wsteth).balanceOf(address(this));
    }
```
The vulnerability out here is that the the whole stETH balance can't be transferred from the account to the Contract, leaving the last 1-2 wei on the sender's account. This is a well known Vulnerability which is also described in [stEth Docs](https://docs.lido.fi/guides/lido-tokens-integration-guide/#1-2-wei-corner-case) . 
So the account will not have enough stEth balance for `safeIncreaseAllowance` into `wsteth` causing revert . 
## Impact
Due to this vulnerability , the `stEth` becomes completely incompatible with `DepositWrapper.sol` contract , thereby causing unexpected reverts. Also the impact becomes bigger , if some other protocol with huge stEth balances ,tries interacting with Mellow's `DepositWrapper.sol` contract .

## Recommendation
As mentioned by the report tagged in , best mitigation would be to use lido recommendation to utilize `transferShares` function, so the _amount is realistic, or implement FoT approach, which compares the balance before and after the transfer.
