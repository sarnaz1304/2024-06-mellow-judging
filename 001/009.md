# Querying `depositBufferedEther()` via the deposit security module is not done correctly


## Summary

Querying `depositBufferedEther()` via the deposit security module is not done correctly.

## Vulnerability Detail

To deposit there is a need to convert the weth amount into wsteth, see https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-mellow/blob/26aa0445ec405a4ad637bddeeedec4efe1eba8d2/mellow-lrt/src/modules/obol/StakingModule.sol#L64-L74

```solidity
    function convertAndDeposit(
..
        _wethToWSteth(amount);
        depositSecurityModule.depositBufferedEther(
            blockNumber,
            blockHash,
            depositRoot,
            stakingModuleId,
            nonce,
            depositCalldata,
            sortedGuardianSignatures
        );
..
}
```

Now take a look at https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-mellow/blob/26aa0445ec405a4ad637bddeeedec4efe1eba8d2/mellow-lrt/src/modules/obol/StakingModule.sol#L77-L83

```solidity
    function _wethToWSteth(uint256 amount) private {
        IWeth(weth).withdraw(amount);
        ISteth(steth).submit{value: amount}(address(0));//@audit protocol assumes steth <-> eth is 1:1,
        IERC20(steth).safeIncreaseAllowance(address(wsteth), amount);
        IWSteth(wsteth).wrap(amount);
    }
}
```

This function is used for conversion from `weth` to `steth`, issue however is that protocol assumes the rate for steth <-> eth is always `1:1`, however this is inaccurate, going to the docs for lido's `submit()`: https://docs.lido.fi/contracts/lido#submit-1

We can see that the function sends funds to the pool and then mints `StETH` tokens, would be key to note that the docs also clearly state that this function **returns the number of StETH shares generated**, which would mean that the conversion rate is not 1:1, and after the deposits to the pool, `submit()` would correctly return the amount of `stETH` shares/tokens generated.

Problem however is that protocol does not take this factor into account and instead directly attempts to wrap the amount attached from the weth value to wsteth, in this line `  IWSteth(wsteth).wrap(amount);`, as previously explained however, this value would either be deflated or inflated, depending on the eth <-> steth going rate.

## Impact

As hinted under _Proof of Concept_, when converting weth to wsteth, protocol assumes a 1:1:1 rate for the conversion from weth <-> eth <-> steth, which would be wrong and would lead to different impact:

- In the case the exchange rate is > 1, this would mean a loss of funds/ unaccounted funds, cause the amount of tokens that end up being attached to `depositBufferedEther()` would be deflated, cause the amount used while wrapping steth to wsteth via `IWSteth(wsteth).wrap(amount);` has also been deflated.
- Alternatively, in the case there is no previous balance of steth in the contract as is expected and the rate of eth <-> steth is < 1, then the attempt at depositing would encounter a revert cause the amount of tokens steth tokens sent from Lido after the `submit`query is less than the amount of tokens the execution attempts to wrap via `IWSteth(wsteth).wrap(amount);`, which would prompt a revert in Lido's code here: https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-dao/blob/5fcedc6e9a9f3ec154e69cff47c2b9e25503a78a/contracts/0.6.12/WstETH.sol#L57 since the amount attempted to be transferred is more than is present in the contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

A common logic used by protocol when _submitting_ eth to Lido is to then query the difference in balance of the contract's steth tokens before and after the deposit, a similar code example can be seen from the just concluded Sophon contest on Sherlock here: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-sophon/blob/05059e53755f24ae9e3a3bb2996de15df0289a6c/farming-contracts/contracts/farm/SophonFarming.sol#L808-L813.

So apply these changes:

```diff
    function _wethToWSteth(uint256 amount) private {
        IWeth(weth).withdraw(amount);
+        uint256 balanceBefore = IERC20(stETH).balanceOf(address(this));
        ISteth(steth).submit{value: amount}(address(0));
+        uint256 amountReceived = IERC20(stETH).balanceOf(address(this)) - balanceBefore);
-        IERC20(steth).safeIncreaseAllowance(address(wsteth), amount);
+        IERC20(steth).safeIncreaseAllowance(address(wsteth), amountReceived);
-        IWSteth(wsteth).wrap(amount);
+        IWSteth(wsteth).wrap(amountReceived);
    }
```
