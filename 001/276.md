# Potential Denial of Service (DoS) in `DepositWrapper` Contract Due to Rounding Errors in `stETH` Transfers

## Summary
The `deposit` function in the `DepositWrapper` contract is susceptible to a known issue with the `stETH` token where rounding errors can cause transferred shares to be 1-2 wei less than the intended `_amount`. This discrepancy can lead to subsequent function calls failing due to insufficient balance, resulting in a potential denial of service (DoS) for users attempting to deposit `stETH`.
## Vulnerability Detail
The issue arises when the `deposit` function processes `stETH` tokens. The `stETH` token uses shares for tracking balances, and due to rounding errors, the transferred shares may be 1-2 wei less than the `_amount` passed. This can cause a mismatch in the expected amount of `stETH` transferred and wrapped into `wstETH`, leading to failures in subsequent operations.

**Detailed Flow:**
1. The `deposit` function receives an `amount` parameter, which is passed to `IERC20(steth).safeTransferFrom(sender, wrapper, amount)`.
2. The `_stethToWsteth` function is called to convert `steth` to `wsteth`.
3. The `_stethToWsteth` function may end up with 1-2 wei less `stETH` due to rounding issues.
4. This discrepancy can cause subsequent function calls, such as wrapping into `wstETH`, to fail because the actual balance is slightly less than expected.

## Impact
The probability of issue appearing is high and you can check in the following discussion. It has also been classified as a High severity on past contests:

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use lido recommendation to utilize transferShares function, so the _amount is realistic, or implement FoT approach, which compares the balance before and after the transfer.
