# [M-01] Low-level `delegatecall` and `call` in `Vault` can fail silently

## Summary
If the `to` address passed to the `delegateCall` & `externalCall` functions does not correspond to an existing contract, the `delegatecall` & `call` operations will still succeed but will likely result in unexpected behavior due to the lack of a contract at the target address. 

## Vulnerability Details

## Impact
The functions perform several checks before attempting the `delegatecall` & `call`. They ensure that the caller has at least operator privileges, that the target address `to` is approved as a delegate module, and that both the sender and the target address pass validation checks through the IValidator interface. However, even after these checks, if the `to` address does not exist or does not have a contract deployed at it, the calls will still execute but might not behave as expected because there's no contract logic to execute.

This could lead to silent failures where the function appears to succeed (since `delegatecall` & `call` return `true` for non-existent accounts), but the actual outcome is undefined due to the absence of a contract at the target address. To mitigate such issues, it's crucial to ensure that the `to` address is valid and contains a contract before performing a delegatecall.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement checks that make sure the account exists prior to transferring or making the calls.
