# Incorrect assumption that 1 stETH equals 1 ETH when calculating TVL

## Summary

With the currently deployed code, and with only wstETH used as the underlying token, the current system holds. However, with the future introduction of rETH or even stablecoins like USDC/USDT, the TVL calculations performed during deposits and withdrawals will be incorrect.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `WStethRatiosAggregatorV3` contract, the returned price is acquired by utilizing the `getStETHByWstETH()` function of the wstETH token contract and, as such, is denominated in stETH. Later, it is used together with `ConstantAggregatorV3`, which is set to return the WETH/ETH price as 1-to-1, thereby making stETH equivalent to ETH in the system.

However, stETH is never 1-to-1 with ETH, as shown [here](https://data.chain.link/feeds/ethereum/mainnet/steth-eth) or [here](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/lido-staked-ether/eth).

## Impact

Incorrect TVL calculations during deposit/withdrawal operations.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Perform cross-oracle querying for the wstETH price. First, by acquiring the exchange ratio wstETH-to-stETH, and next, by calling the stETH/ETH Chainlink price feed.
