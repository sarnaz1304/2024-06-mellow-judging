# Protocol/Depositor is missing out on referral rewards by setting referral address to address(0).

## Summary
Protocol/Depositor is missing out on referral rewards by setting referral address to address(0).

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
    function _ethToWsteth(uint256 amount) private returns (uint256) {
        ISteth(steth).submit{value: amount}(address(0));
        return _stethToWsteth(amount);
    }
```
In the ``_ethToWsteth`` function, the referral address is set to address(0) for Lido ``ISteth(steth).submit`` function.

## Impact
Protocol/Depositor is missing out on referral rewards as the referral address is set to address(0).

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Instead of setting the referral address to ``address(0)``, set it to the protocol admin or the depositor address. Free rewards won't hurt anyone and will be much appreciated by anyone using the protocol.
