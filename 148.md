# `SimpleDVTStakingStrategy::processWithdrawals` does not check low level delegateCall response

## Summary
`SimpleDVTStakingStrategy::processWithdrawals` does not check delegateCall response which will not revert in case of low level delegate call error.

## Vulnerability Detail
`SimpleDVTStakingStrategy::processWithdrawals` calls `vault.delegateCall` function. This calls low level `to.delegatecall(data)` function. It retuns success boolean instead of revert. The protocol does not check if is false neither in the Vault contract, nor in the SimpleDVTStakingStrategy contract. It means in case delegate call fails, `statuses = vault.processWithdrawals(users);` inside of `SimpleDVTStakingStrategy::processWithdrawals` will be still executed

## Impact
Can lead to unexpected functioning inside `SimpleDVTStakingStrategy::processWithdrawals` function
