# Inconsistent function name and logic in `requireProposerOrAcceptor` modifier

## Summary
The function name `requireProposerOrAcceptor` does not accurately reflect the logic implemented in the corresponding modifier. This inconsistency may lead to confusion and potential misunderstandings for developers working with the code.

## Vulnerability Detail
The current implementation of the `requireProposerOrAcceptor` modifier checks if the `msg.sender` is not the proposer or acceptor. This contradicts the intended functionality implied by the function name, which suggests that only the proposer or acceptor should be allowed.

```solidity
modifier requireProposerOrAcceptor() {
    if (msg.sender != proposer && msg.sender != acceptor)
        revert Forbidden();
    _;
}
```

## Impact
The mismatch between the function name and logic can potentially cause confusion during code maintenance and review. Developers relying on the function name may assume that only the proposer or acceptor can execute the associated code, leading to incorrect assumptions and potential vulnerabilities.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to update the modifier to align the function name with the actual logic, ensuring that only the proposer or acceptor can execute the code within the modifier.

```solidity
modifier requireProposerOrAcceptor() {
    if (msg.sender != proposer || msg.sender != acceptor)
        revert Forbidden();
    _;
}
```
