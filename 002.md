# Inadequate check to prevent inflaction attack

## Summary
Inflaction attack is still possible if the initial deposit is too small.

## Vulnerability Detail

The deposit function ensures that only the admin or operator can make the initial deposit to the vault, which is intended to prevent the inflaction attack, [Vault#L355](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-mellow/blob/26aa0445ec405a4ad637bddeeedec4efe1eba8d2/mellow-lrt/src/Vault.sol#L355-L357):

```solidity
            _requireAtLeastOperator();
            lpAmount = minLpAmount;
            if (lpAmount == 0) revert ValueZero();
```

However, it only ensures the `lpAmount` cannot be zero, which mean the minimum initial deposit can be 1.

As the [oz blog: A Novel Defense Against ERC4626 Inflation Attacks](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/a-novel-defense-against-erc4626-inflation-attacks) suggested, "The more assets deposited initially, the more challenging it becomes to execute an inflation attack. However, sufficient funds must be available for the initial deposit, as they are effectively lost.", the initial deposit should be sufficient funds.

Attack senario:

1. The admin deposit tokens and lock 1 LP.
2. Attacker sandwish victim tx with inflaction attack.

## Impact
Potential inflaction attack.
