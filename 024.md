# removing or adding tokens will make all current withdraw requests fail

## Summary
If a token is removed or added, all current pending withdrawals will become un-executable and thus canceled.

## Vulnerability Detail
When a user registers a withdrawal, they call [registerWithdrawal](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-mellow/blob/main/mellow-lrt/src/Vault.sol#L464) with some parameters, including `tokensHash` - a hash of all the current tokens.

When an admin processes a withdrawal, [analyzeRequest](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-mellow/blob/main/mellow-lrt/src/Vault.sol#L476) is triggered to check the withdrawal. This request compares the info provided by [calculateStack](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-mellow/blob/main/mellow-lrt/src/Vault.sol#L507) to the user's request. If the new `tokensHash` (`keccak256(abi.encode(tokens))`) doesn't match the request's `tokensHash`, the request will be canceled.

Given the fact that withdraws are executed by Operators and not by users, a canceled withdraw can mean that the use needs to wait another few days or a week before another withdraw is done.

## Impact
Removing or adding a token will cancel all current withdrawal requests.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
if (request.tokensHash != s.tokensHash || request.deadline < s.timestamp)
    return (false, false, expectedAmounts);
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Instead of using token hashes, use the `minAmounts` value from the user's request. If the `minAmounts` is 0, continue with the withdrawal instead of canceling the request.
