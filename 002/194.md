# User doesn’t receive back the left deposited amount

## Summary
The incorrect price of the priceX96 would be returned if we deal with USDC underlying tokens for example. It will cause the user to not get back his amount of deposited tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail
For the sake of the simplicity, let’s concentrate purely on the part, which defines how much tokens should be transferred from the user to the contract.

```solidity
for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokens.length; i++) {
//e: get the priceX96 based on the depositedToken and baseVaultToken
uint256 priceX96 = priceOracle.priceX96(address(this), tokens[i]);
totalValue += totalAmounts[i] == 0 //e: if first deposit -> 0, else 
? 0 //@audit 
: FullMath.mulDivRoundingUp(totalAmounts[i], priceX96, Q96); 

if (ratiosX96[i] == 0) continue;
uint256 amount = FullMath.mulDiv(ratioX96, ratiosX96[i], Q96);
IERC20(tokens[i]).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
actualAmounts[i] = amount;

depositValue += FullMath.mulDiv(amount, priceX96, Q96);
}
```

- Firstly, the priceX96 would be calculated for the token that we deposit, in our case it is USDC. How it would be calculated?
    - It takes the answer and decimals of the USDC feed.
    - It takes the answer and decimals of the wsETH feed.
    - Then, it does it → 
    `priceX96_ = FullMath.mulDiv(tokenPrice * 10 ** baseDecimals, Q96, baseTokenPrice * 10 ** decimals);`
    
    So, according to the dev comment, the chainlink feed for USDC would be taken as USDC-USD. This, the priceX96 would result in 67664305257018565958499669172. Let’s see how
    
    ```solidity
    priceX96_ = FullMath.mulDiv(tokenPrice * 10 ** baseDecimals, Q96, baseTokenPrice * 10 ** decimals);
    //////PoC////////
    //The base token price is 1170747931602013434 because it would be returned from the getStETHByWstETH
    Scenario with USDC-USD feed
     - 99986978 is USDC-USD chainlink answer
     - 10^18 - decimals of the wsETH answer
     - 1170747931602013434 answer of the wsETH feed.
     - 10^8 decimals of the USDC answer
     //Calculation
     (99986978 * 10^18) * 2^96 / (1170747931602013434 * 10^8) = 67664305257018565958499669172
    ```
    
    The main problem here are: 
    1. `amount` that would be transferred from the user would be correct(rounded a bit), BUT
    2. the `depositValue` would result in fewer token than amount! Let’s take a look 
        
        ```solidity
        depositValue += FullMath.mulDiv(amount, priceX96, Q96);
        //// PoC ///////
        = 99e6 * 67664305257018565958499669172 / Q96 = 84550316 (84.5e6) 
        result: 15 USDC isn't returned back!
        ```

## Impact
User don’t receive the funds back. It means → lost.

## Recommendation
Ensure that user could receive the difference that is left in the contract.
