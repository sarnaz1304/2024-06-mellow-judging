# Vault contract can't handle ``USDC/USDT`` tokens.

## Summary
Vault contract can't handle ``USDC/USDT`` tokens or other tokens less than 18 decimals.

## Vulnerability Detail
As per the readme:
> In src/oracles/ChainlinkOracle.sol, the priceX96 function does not take into account IERC20(base).decimals() and IERC20(token).decimals() when converting. For the current deployment, this is not a problem because the system operates with tokens from the set [weth, wsteth, steth].

``weth, wsteth, steth`` are all 18 decimals tokens but for tokens like ``usdt/usdc`` which has 6 decimals, the calculation will be incorrect  in the  ``priceX96`` function.

Vault contract uses ``priceX96()`` function [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-mellow/blob/main/mellow-lrt/src/Vault.sol#L323) and [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-mellow/blob/main/mellow-lrt/src/Vault.sol#L528) and using tokens  with ``<18`` decimals for depositing will lead to inflated ``priceX96`` value calculation which ultimately leads to more ``lpAmount`` being minted for depositing.

## Impact
If tokens with less than ``18 decimals`` are added as underlying tokens, the protocol won't be able to handle them resulting in incorrect accounting as ``pricex96`` plays a huge role in ``lpAmount`` calculation while depositing and withdrawing.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Modify the ``priceX96()`` function to properly scale for tokens  with ``<18`` decimals like ``usdc/usdt``.
