# `Vault:: _processLpAmount` can revert when total value = zero

## Summary
In `Vault:: _processLpAmount` when counting `lpAmount` to mint, the function can revert due to dividing by zero, if `totalValue` is zero.

## Vulnerability Detail
The thing is that `totalValue` originates from an underlying token tvl. This tvl can equal to zero, as stated in `_calculateTvl` function , when we have this subtraction:
```solidity
amounts[i] -= negativeAmounts[i];
```
So if we have such a combination of amounts that the subtraction gives us zero tvl at the end, it will lead to zero division when counting how many tokens to mint after deposit:
```solidity
lpAmount = FullMath.mulDiv(depositValue, totalSupply, totalValue);
```

## Impact
Can revert mint process when tvl equals to zero due to subtraction of negative amounts from positive amounts

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Avoid division by zero, or change this:
```diff
- if (amounts[i] < negativeAmounts[i]) revert InvalidState();
+ if (amounts[i] <= negativeAmounts[i]) revert InvalidState();
```
