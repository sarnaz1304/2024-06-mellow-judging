# Withdrawals cannot be processed or settled before their their deadline

## Summary
When users make a withdrawal request, they specify a [`requestDeadline`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-mellow/blob/main/mellow-lrt/src/interfaces/IVault.sol#L241-L242) which is the _The deadline before which the request should be fulfilled_. 
However,  during [withdrawal processing](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-mellow/blob/main/mellow-lrt/src/Vault.sol#L548-L551), the `analyzeRequest(...)` function is called which checks if the deadline has elapsed as shown below on `L482`

```solidity
File: Vault.sol
475:     /// @inheritdoc IVault
476:     function analyzeRequest(
477:         ProcessWithdrawalsStack memory s,
478:         WithdrawalRequest memory request
479:     ) public pure returns (bool, bool, uint256[] memory expectedAmounts) { // processingPossible, withdrawalPossible, expectedAmounts
480:         uint256 lpAmount = request.lpAmount;
481:         if (
482: @>          request.tokensHash != s.tokensHash || request.deadline < s.timestamp 
483:         ) return (false, false, expectedAmounts); // processingPossible, withdrawalPossible, expectedAmounts
484: 

```

## Vulnerability Detail
Notice  from `L482` that `analyzeRequest(...)` function returns `processingPossible == false` and `withdrawalPossible == false` if the `request.deadline` is not up to the current vault state deadline evaluated in the [`calculateStack(...)`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-mellow/blob/main/mellow-lrt/src/Vault.sol#L521) function

## Impact
- breaks core protocol functionality
- this can lead to cancellation of withdrawals forcing the users to withdraw at a loss with emergency withdrawal making users spend more gas to request the same withdrawal again

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
modify the `analyzeRequest(...)` function as shown below as shown below

```solidity
File: Vault.sol
475:     /// @inheritdoc IVault
476:     function analyzeRequest(
477:         ProcessWithdrawalsStack memory s,
478:         WithdrawalRequest memory request
479:     ) public pure returns (bool, bool, uint256[] memory expectedAmounts) { // processingPossible, withdrawalPossible, expectedAmounts
480:         uint256 lpAmount = request.lpAmount;
481:         if (
482:  -          request.tokensHash != s.tokensHash || request.deadline < s.timestamp 
482:  +          request.tokensHash != s.tokensHash || request.deadline > s.timestamp 
483:         ) return (false, false, expectedAmounts); // processingPossible, withdrawalPossible, expectedAmounts
484:
