# Anyone can DoS `vault::removeToken` by front-running call with transfer of 1 wei of the token to be removed

## Summary
Anyone can DoS `vault::removeToken` by sending 1 wei of the token to be removed

## Vulnerability Detail
Vaults can have multiple tokens as underlying assets.
To add a token to a vault, admins must call `vault::addToken(address token)` 
Then user are able to deposit that token into the vault.
If admins decide that a token should be removed from the vault, they must call `vault::removeToken(address token)`
The issue here, is that the function [will revert if the amount of tokens held by the vault is non zero]
This allow an attacker to prevent any attempt to call that function by simply sending 1 wei of the asset before the admin tx.

(https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-mellow/blob/main/mellow-lrt/src/Vault.sol#L212-L212).
```solidity
File: src/Vault.sol
205:     function removeToken(address token) external nonReentrant {
206:         _requireAdmin();
207:         if (!_isUnderlyingToken[token]) revert InvalidToken();
208:         (address[] memory tokens, uint256[] memory amounts) = underlyingTvl();
209:         uint256 index = tokens.length;
210:         for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokens.length; i++) {
211:             if (tokens[i] == token) {
212: ❌           if (amounts[i] != 0) revert NonZeroValue();
213:                 index = i;
214:                 break;
215:             }
216:         }
```


This can also be DoS'd by a front-run call of `vault::deposit()` 

## Impact
DoS by anyone of the admin-controlled `removeToken()` function

## Code Snippet

Add this test to `tests/mainnet/unit/VaultTest.t.sol`

```solidity
    function test_audit_DoSRemoveToken() external {
        Vault vault = new Vault("Mellow LRT Vault", "mLRT", admin);
        vm.startPrank(admin);
        ERC20TvlModule tvlModule = new ERC20TvlModule();
        vault.addToken(Constants.WETH);
        vault.addTvlModule(address(tvlModule));
		vm.stopPrank();

		//malicious user front-run the 'removeToken' call with a 1 wei transfer
        deal(Constants.WETH, address(this), 1 wei);
		IERC20(Constants.WETH).transfer(address(vault), 1 wei);

		vm.prank(admin);
        vm.expectRevert(abi.encodeWithSignature("NonZeroValue()"));
        vault.removeToken(Constants.WETH);
	}
```

Manual review

## Recommendation

Rather than relying on `balanceOf` to account for deposited tokens, use a state variable. The drawback here is that rebasing tokens wouldn't be supported.
There might be a solution without this drawback (2 step process is an idea) but this would complexify the process.

Regarding the `vault::deposit()` case which would also DoS the `vault::removeToken()` call, adding a pause or a 2-step process would solve the issue.
