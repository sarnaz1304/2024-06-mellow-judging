# deposit might revert for some scenarios in DepositWrapper

## Summary
In the `vault.deposit` it is seen that if `amounts.length != tokens.length`, the deposit should revert.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `vault.deposit` it is seen that if `amounts.length != tokens.length`, the deposit should revert. There are also function to add and remove tokens in the vault contract, meaning a possibility of multiple tokens in the set [eth, weth, stEth, WstEth] added to the vault contract

## Impact

A Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack could be mounted against deposit operations until the tokens causing the mismatch are removed, and the vault accepts only a single type of token.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

add a check for length of underlying tokens to match the tokens length in the vault and ensure the amount is at the index of the wsETH token in the deposit Wrapper

```solidity
        IERC20(wsteth).safeIncreaseAllowance(address(vault), amount);
+       uint length = vault.underlyingTokens();
+       uint256[] memory amounts = new uint256[](length);
-       uint256[] memory amounts = new uint256[](1);
+       // uint index = index of underlying token address == wstETH
+       // amounts[index] = amount;
-       amounts[0] = amount;
        (, lpAmount) = vault.deposit(to, amounts, minLpAmount, deadline);
        uint256 balance = IERC20(wsteth).balanceOf(wrapper);
        if (balance > 0) IERC20(wsteth).safeTransfer(sender, balance);
        emit DepositWrapperDeposit(sender, token, amount, lpAmount, deadline);

```
