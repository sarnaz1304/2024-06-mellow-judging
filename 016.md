# L-2: `public` functions not used internally could be marked `external`

## Summary

Instead of marking a function as `public`, consider marking it as `external` if it is not used internally.

## Vulnerability Detail

Marking functions as `external` when they are not used internally can lead to gas savings. The `external` keyword is more gas-efficient compared to `public` because it allows the function to directly access calldata arguments instead of making an intermediate copy in memory, which is what `public` functions do.

## Impact

Optimizing gas usage by marking appropriate functions as `external` can lead to cost savings for users and improve the overall efficiency of the smart contract.

## Recommendation

Review your smart contract code and identify functions that are marked as `public` but are not used internally. Change their visibility to `external` to improve gas efficiency.
