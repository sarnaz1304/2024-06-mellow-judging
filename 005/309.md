# Emergency Withdrawal Rounding Error Causes Insufficient Payouts

## Summary
The emergencyWithdraw function in the contract exhibits a rounding error when calculating token amounts for withdrawal. This rounding issue causes users to receive slightly less than their expected amount of tokens, which can lead to the function reverting if the calculated amount is less than the minimum specified. This impacts user experience and can cause unnecessary transaction failures.
## Vulnerability Detail
The emergencyWithdraw function processes emergency withdrawals by transferring tokens based on the user's LP token holdings. The calculation for the token amount is performed using ``FullMath.mulDiv``, which may round down the result due to integer division. If the total supply of LP tokens is greater than the token balance in the contract, this rounding error can result in the calculated withdrawal amount being less than the minimum specified (minAmounts). This discrepancy causes the function to revert, even if the actual token balance might have been sufficient to meet the minimum requirements.
```solidity
function emergencyWithdraw(
    uint256[] memory minAmounts,
    uint256 deadline
)
    external
    nonReentrant
    checkDeadline(deadline)
    returns (uint256[] memory actualAmounts)
{
    uint256 timestamp = block.timestamp;
    address sender = msg.sender;
    if (!_pendingWithdrawers.contains(sender)) revert InvalidState();
    WithdrawalRequest memory request = _withdrawalRequest[sender];
    if (timestamp > request.deadline) {
        _cancelWithdrawalRequest(sender);
        return actualAmounts;
    }

    if (
        request.timestamp + configurator.emergencyWithdrawalDelay() >
        timestamp
    ) revert InvalidState();

    uint256 totalSupply = totalSupply();
    (address[] memory tokens, uint256[] memory amounts) = baseTvl();
    if (minAmounts.length != tokens.length) revert InvalidLength(); // should be amounts instead of minAmounts
    actualAmounts = new uint256[](tokens.length);
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokens.length; i++) {
        if (amounts[i] == 0) {
            if (minAmounts[i] != 0) revert InsufficientAmount();
            continue;
        }
        uint256 amount = FullMath.mulDiv(  // here
            IERC20(tokens[i]).balanceOf(address(this)),
            request.lpAmount,
            totalSupply
        );
        if (amount < minAmounts[i]) revert InsufficientAmount();
        IERC20(tokens[i]).safeTransfer(request.to, amount);
        actualAmounts[i] = amount;
    }
    delete _withdrawalRequest[sender];
    _pendingWithdrawers.remove(sender);
    _burn(address(this), request.lpAmount);
    emit EmergencyWithdrawal(sender, request, actualAmounts);
}
