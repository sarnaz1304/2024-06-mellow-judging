# user will withdraw more  if a tvl module is added before they call `emergencyWithdraw(....)`

## Summary
The Vault::emergencyWithdraw(...) function is called by a user to withdraw after if their withdrawals are not processed within the withdrawal delay period. And they can only receive ERC20 tokens. The functions relies heavily on the base tvl of the vault as shown from the code below, 

```solidity
File: Vault.sol
122:     function baseTvl()
123:         public
124:         view
125:         returns (address[] memory tokens, uint256[] memory amounts)
126:     {
127:         ITvlModule.Data[] memory data = _tvls(); // Data[] from all the TVL modules
128: @>      tokens = new address[](data.length);
129:         uint256 length = 0;
130:         for (uint256 i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {

135:             }



154:     function _tvls() private view returns (ITvlModule.Data[] memory data) {
155:         ITvlModule.Data[][] memory responses = new ITvlModule.Data[][]( 
156:             _tvlModules.length()
157:         );
158:         uint256 length = 0;
159:         for (uint256 i = 0; i < responses.length; i++) { 
160:             address module = _tvlModules.at(i);
161:             responses[i] = ITvlModule(module).tvl(address(this));.
162:             length += responses[i].length;
163:         }
164: @>      data = new ITvlModule.Data[](length);

228:         _requireAdmin();
229:         ITvlModule.Data[] memory data = ITvlModule(module).tvl(address(this));
230:         for (uint256 i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
231:             if (!_isUnderlyingToken[data[i].underlyingToken])

233:         }

236:         }

377:         uint256 deadline

379:         external
380:         nonReentrant

383:     {

395: @>      (address[] memory tokens, uint256[] memory amounts) = baseTvl();

398: @>      for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokens.length; i++) {
SNIP

403: @>          uint256 amount = FullMath.mulDiv(
404:                 IERC20(tokens[i]).balanceOf(address(this)),
405:                 request.lpAmount,
406:                 totalSupply
407:             );
408:             if (amount < minAmounts[i]) revert InsufficientAmount();
409: @>          IERC20(tokens[i]).safeTransfer(request.to, amount);
410:             actualAmounts[i] = amount;
411:         }
SNIP
.....
416:     }


```
if a module is added the length of the tokens increases. As seen on `L164`, the `tokens` length as seen on `L128` also increases. 
Notice that the length of the tokens on `L398` is as evaluated from `L128`. Thus, when `emergencyWithdraw(...)` is called, the new length of tokens is looped over on `L398` and the `amount` as calculated on `L403` equivalent to the user's `request.lpAmount`.

The problem is that the user now gets a share of this this new modules token even if he didn't part because he has the liberty to specify the `minAmounts`. Hence he earns more subject to this new module that was added.

## Vulnerability Detail
- Alice deposits when there are 2 tvl modules attached the vault with 2 tokens
- Alice requests withdrawal
- Admin add an one more tvl module making it 3 tvl modules attached to the vault
- Bob deposits with 3 tvl modules now attached to the vault
- Withdrawal delay period passes and Alice withdrawal is not processed
- Alice calls `emergencyWithdraw(....)`
- Alice receives tokens from all modules  possible reducing bobs share of the new module that was added



## Impact
Users earn more by using the `emergencyWithdraw(....)` leading to loss of funds for the protocol and leak of value

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
A trivial solution is not in sight here, but protocol may want to consider doing some caching as regards the state of the vault at the point of deposit to better refund users during an emergency withdrawal.
