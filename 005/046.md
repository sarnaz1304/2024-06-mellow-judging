# Lack of LP Token Balance Check in emergencyWithdraw Function

## Summary
The `emergencyWithdraw` function in the `Vault.sol` contract does not check if the amount of LP tokens (`request.lpAmount`) a user wants to withdraw exceeds their actual LP token balance. This could lead to users withdrawing more tokens than they actually own, causing an imbalance in the system.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `emergencyWithdraw` function allows users to withdraw funds urgently from the vault under certain circumstances. However, this function does not check if `request.lpAmount` (the amount of LP tokens the user wants to withdraw) is less than or equal to the user's LP token balance (`balanceOf(sender)`). Without this check, a malicious user could create a withdrawal request with an `lpAmount` greater than their balance and still be able to withdraw that amount.

## Impact
This vulnerability could be exploited to withdraw an amount of tokens exceeding the amount the user actually owns.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
    function emergencyWithdraw(
        uint256[] memory minAmounts,
        uint256 deadline
    )
        external
        nonReentrant
        checkDeadline(deadline)
        returns (uint256[] memory actualAmounts)
    {
        uint256 timestamp = block.timestamp;
        address sender = msg.sender;
        if (!_pendingWithdrawers.contains(sender)) revert InvalidState();
        WithdrawalRequest memory request = _withdrawalRequest[sender];
        if (timestamp > request.deadline) {
            _cancelWithdrawalRequest(sender);
            return actualAmounts;
        }

        if (
            request.timestamp + configurator.emergencyWithdrawalDelay() >
            timestamp
        ) revert InvalidState();

        uint256 totalSupply = totalSupply();
        (address[] memory tokens, uint256[] memory amounts) = baseTvl();
        if (minAmounts.length != tokens.length) revert InvalidLength();
        actualAmounts = new uint256[](tokens.length);
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokens.length; i++) {
            if (amounts[i] == 0) {
                if (minAmounts[i] != 0) revert InsufficientAmount();
                continue;
            }
            uint256 amount = FullMath.mulDiv(
                IERC20(tokens[i]).balanceOf(address(this)),
                request.lpAmount,
                totalSupply
            );
            if (amount < minAmounts[i]) revert InsufficientAmount();
            IERC20(tokens[i]).safeTransfer(request.to, amount);
            actualAmounts[i] = amount;
        }
        delete _withdrawalRequest[sender];
        _pendingWithdrawers.remove(sender);
        _burn(address(this), request.lpAmount);
        emit EmergencyWithdrawal(sender, request, actualAmounts);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
add a check at the beginning of the emergencyWithdraw function to ensure that request.lpAmount does not exceed the user LP token balance

```solidity
    function emergencyWithdraw(
        uint256[] memory minAmounts,
        uint256 deadline
    )
        external
        nonReentrant
        checkDeadline(deadline)
        returns (uint256[] memory actualAmounts)
    {
        uint256 timestamp = block.timestamp;
        address sender = msg.sender;
        if (!_pendingWithdrawers.contains(sender)) revert InvalidState();
        WithdrawalRequest memory request = _withdrawalRequest[sender];
        if (timestamp > request.deadline) {
            _cancelWithdrawalRequest(sender);
            return actualAmounts;
        }

        if (
            request.timestamp + configurator.emergencyWithdrawalDelay() >
            timestamp
        ) revert InvalidState();

+      if (request.lpAmount > balanceOf(sender)) revert InsufficientBalance();

        uint256 totalSupply = totalSupply();
        (address[] memory tokens, uint256[] memory amounts) = baseTvl();
        if (minAmounts.length != tokens.length) revert InvalidLength();
        actualAmounts = new uint256[](tokens.length);
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokens.length; i++) {
            if (amounts[i] == 0) {
                if (minAmounts[i] != 0) revert InsufficientAmount();
                continue;
            }
            uint256 amount = FullMath.mulDiv(
                IERC20(tokens[i]).balanceOf(address(this)),
                request.lpAmount,
                totalSupply
            );
            if (amount < minAmounts[i]) revert InsufficientAmount();
            IERC20(tokens[i]).safeTransfer(request.to, amount);
            actualAmounts[i] = amount;
        }
        delete _withdrawalRequest[sender];
        _pendingWithdrawers.remove(sender);
        _burn(address(this), request.lpAmount);
        emit EmergencyWithdrawal(sender, request, actualAmounts);
    }
