# Withdrawals can be DOS'd due to `USDC` blacklist

## Summary
withdrawals can be DOS'd due to `USDC` blacklist

## Vulnerability Detail
USDC has a blaclist feature which disallows transferring assets to any blacklisted user. A user can leverage this to create a withdrawal request where the recipient is set as a blacklisted user. This will cause the process withdrawal transaction to revert disallowing the withdrawal of other user's too

```solidity
    function processWithdrawals(
        address[] memory users
    ) external nonReentrant returns (bool[] memory statuses) {
            ....

            for (uint256 j = 0; j < s.tokens.length; j++) {
                s.erc20Balances[j] -= expectedAmounts[j];
                IERC20(s.tokens[j]).safeTransfer(
                    request.to,
                    expectedAmounts[j]
                );
            }
```

The attacker is not at loss of these assets since they can cancel the request anytime by invoking the `cancelWithdrawalRequest` function

## Impact
Withdrawals will be DOS'd

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Keep a seperate escrow contract for the funds / keep a try-catch block for transfer's / if planning specifically for usdc, can invoke the `isBlacklisted` function in the analyze request function to filter such requests
