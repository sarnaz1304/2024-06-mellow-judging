# processWithdrawals can be blocked

## Summary

In Vaults with USDC, USDT `processWithdrawals` by users passing blacklisted `to` address as a recipient.

## Vulnerability Detail

`vault::registerWithdrawal` makes it possible for users to provide `to` address that will receive the underlying assets when batch withdrawal is being executed by the operator. The problem is that `to` can be blacklisted in either of the tokens and revert the entire withdrawal process. 

```solidity
function processWithdrawals(
    address[] memory users
) external nonReentrant returns (bool[] memory statuses) {
..MORE CODE
        for (uint256 j = 0; j < s.tokens.length; j++) {
            s.erc20Balances[j] -= expectedAmounts[j];
            IERC20(s.tokens[j]).safeTransfer(
                request.to,
                expectedAmounts[j]
            );
        }
...MORE CODE
}
```

Even more, as there is no way this request to be forcefully removed by a trusted address, `processWithdrawals` will always revert, unless `DefaultBondStrategy::processWithdrawals` is being called each time, manually specifying the users whose requests will be processed.  

The root cause is the same as the valid example provided in the Sherlock documentation: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-opyn-judging/issues/219

## Impact

- The impact is that the withdrawal functionality will be highly restricted if a lot blacklisted recipients are being presented and also protocol users will be harmed by not being able to get their requests fulfilled.

## Recommendation

Do not transfer tokens in a loop, instead use mapping so each withdrawer can claim their tokens by themselves.
