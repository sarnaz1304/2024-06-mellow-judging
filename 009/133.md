# USDC blacklisted address can DoS the `processWithdrawals` function in `Vault.sol`

0xShiki

## Summary
The function `processWithdrawals` processes multiple withdrawal requests by accepting an array of addresses and process them in a for loop. However, transferring to a USDC blacklisted address with the `safeTransfer()` method will fail, which will lead to reverting the whole transaction.

## Vulnerability Detail
```javascript
    function processWithdrawals(address[] memory users) external nonReentrant returns (bool[] memory statuses) {
        _requireAtLeastOperator();
        statuses = new bool[](users.length);
        ProcessWithdrawalsStack memory s = calculateStack();
        uint256 burningSupply = 0;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < users.length; i++) {
            address user = users[i];
            if (!_pendingWithdrawers.contains(user)) continue;
            WithdrawalRequest memory request = _withdrawalRequest[user];
            (bool isProcessingPossible, bool isWithdrawalPossible, uint256[] memory expectedAmounts) =
                analyzeRequest(s, request);

            if (!isProcessingPossible) {
                _cancelWithdrawalRequest(user);
                continue;
            }

            if (!isWithdrawalPossible) continue;

            for (uint256 j = 0; j < s.tokens.length; j++) {
                s.erc20Balances[j] -= expectedAmounts[j];
@>              IERC20(s.tokens[j]).safeTransfer(request.to, expectedAmounts[j]);
            }

            burningSupply += request.lpAmount;
            delete _withdrawalRequest[user];
            _pendingWithdrawers.remove(user);
            statuses[i] = true;
        }

        if (burningSupply == 0) return statuses;
        _burn(address(this), burningSupply);
        emit WithdrawalsProcessed(users, statuses);

        address callback = configurator.withdrawalCallback();
        if (callback == address(0)) return statuses;
        IWithdrawalCallback(callback).withdrawalCallback();
        emit WithdrawCallback(callback);
    }
```
## Impact
DoS of the `processWithdrawals` function in `Vault.sol`

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider creating a function, which checks if a user is a USDC blacklisted address, so the function can skip blacklisted
addresses and continue processing the rest of the withdrawal requests.
