# DOS of Staking Strategy Withdrawals

## Summary
In SimpleDVTStakingStrategy, `processWithdrawals` revert if balance of wstETH > maxAllowedRemainder. An attacker can DOS withdrawals by donating some wstETH to the vault.

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity 
// SimpleDVTStakingStrategy.sol

function processWithdrawals(
        address[] memory users,
        uint256 amountForStake
    ) external returns (bool[] memory statuses) {
        ...
        statuses = vault.processWithdrawals(users);
        address wsteth = stakingModule.wsteth();
        uint256 balance = IERC20(wsteth).balanceOf(address(vault));
        if (balance > maxAllowedRemainder) revert LimitOverflow(); //@audit can be DOSed thru donation
    }
```
In the test files, `maxAllowedRemainder` is set to `1 gwei`. Therefore, an attacker can front run a `processWithdrawals` call by donating wstETH such that `balance` exceeds `maxAllowedRemainder`and DOS the withdrawal.

See POC here https://gist.github.com/giraffe0x/c45330d1a7efeaf9c49ebb1babbc8750.
## Impact
Admin cannot process withdrawals for users. Users will have to resort to using emergencyWithdraw and may end up receiving less tokens and losing funds.

## Recommendation
Consider tracking balance internally to prevent donation-type attacks.
