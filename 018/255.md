# Obol strategy withdrawals can be DOS'd due to `maxAllowedRemainder`

## Summary
Obol strategy withdrawals can be DOS'd due to `maxAllowedRemainder`

## Vulnerability Detail
When processing withdrawals from obol strategy, it is checked that the remaining wstETH after the withdrawal in the contract is less than `maxAllowedRemainder`

```solidity
    function processWithdrawals(
        address[] memory users,
        uint256 amountForStake
    ) external returns (bool[] memory statuses) {
        
        ....

        statuses = vault.processWithdrawals(users);
        address wsteth = stakingModule.wsteth();
        uint256 balance = IERC20(wsteth).balanceOf(address(vault));
        if (balance > maxAllowedRemainder) revert LimitOverflow();
```

A user can front run the call to `processWithdrawals` and cancel / change the lpAmount of their withdrawal in order to modify their cancellation request and hence make the wstETH balance after the conversion greater than the `maxAllowedRemainder`

Eg: 
maxAllowedRemainder is 20
initial wstETH balance = 100
sum of user withdrawals = 150
processWithdrawals is called with amountToStake as 60
user A whose withdrawal amount was 20 cancels the request
now after conversion and withdrawal, there will be (100 - 130 + 60) == 30 wstETH remaining and hence the processWithdrawal call will revert 

## Impact
DOS on withdrawals from obol strategy when the withdrawal call involves weth to wstETH conversion

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Compute the required amount inside the `processWithdrawals` call instead of relying on the passed in parameter
