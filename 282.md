# User's can arbitrage significant price updates if withdrawal/deposits ratios are different

## Summary
User's can arbitrage significant price updates if withdrawal/deposits ratios are different 

## Vulnerability Detail
The vault contract has preset ratio's in which the deposits and withdrawals from a vault occur. And these can be different

```solidity
    function getTargetRatiosX96(
        address vault,
        bool isDeposit
    ) external view override returns (uint128[] memory) {
```

The difference in ratio's acts similar to swap (ie. if we deposit x value of tokens as a,b,c amount of tokens, we would receive d,e,f amount of tokens out worth the same amount). The tokens are priced using chainlink oracle which can have deviations from the actual market price. RETH-ETH oracle has a maximum [allowed deviation](https://data.chain.link/feeds/ethereum/mainnet/reth-eth) of 2%. This allows user's to arbitrage depending on the difference in deposit/withdrawal ratio

Eg:
If the deposit ratio is [100 reth,0 eth] while the withdraw ratio is [0 reth,100 eth] and the price of reth drops 2%, user's can attain a 2% gain by depositing and completing a withdrawal.
 
## Impact
User's can arbitrage depending on the deposit/withdrawal ratios, price difference and the timing of the processWithdrawal call

## Code Snippet

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Can time the withdrawals to not occur near price update periods
