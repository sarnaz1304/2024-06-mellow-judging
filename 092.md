# Event Emission on Role Changes in `DefaultAccesControl.sol`

## Summary
It is good practice to emit events when roles are granted or revoked, as it keeps an on-chain trail of changes for users to view.

## Vulnerability Detail
Without events, itâ€™s harder to track changes to roles, making it more challenging to audit and monitor the contract.

Insert the event emissions somewhere within that linked code. 

## Impact
If an admin role is compromised and roles are changed without emitting events, it would be difficult to detect the change quickly. Plus this adds more transparency for the users of the protocol.

## Code Snippet

Potential code that could be added. 

```javascript
// Hypothetical event declaration
event RoleGranted(bytes32 indexed role, address indexed account, address indexed sender);
event RoleRevoked(bytes32 indexed role, address indexed account, address indexed sender);

// Emitting events in grant/revoke functions
_grantRole(OPERATOR, admin);
emit RoleGranted(OPERATOR, admin, msg.sender);
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Emit events when both roles are granted or revoked to ensure transparency for the protocol.
