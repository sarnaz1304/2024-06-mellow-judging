# Missing check for contract address in `proposeBaseImplementation` function

## Summary
The `proposeBaseImplementation` function lacks a check to ensure that the implementation parameter represents a valid contract address rather than an EOA. This omission may lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities in the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `proposeBaseImplementation` function does not include a verification step to confirm that the implementation parameter is a contract address. 

```solidity
function proposeBaseImplementation(
    address implementation,
    bytes calldata callData
) external requireProposerOrAcceptor {
    if (implementation == address(0)) revert Forbidden();
    _proposedBaseImplementation = Proposal({
        implementation: implementation,
        callData: callData
    });
    emit BaseImplementationProposed(_proposedBaseImplementation, tx.origin);
}
```

As a result, it is possible for an EOA to be passed as the implementation, which could cause unintended consequences or security risks.

And the same issue in `propose(address implementation, bytes calldata callData)` function.

## Impact
This could lead to unexpected errors or vulnerabilities in the contract's functionality. It is crucial to ensure that only valid contract addresses are accepted to maintain the integrity and security of the system.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to include a check to ensure that the implementation parameter represents a valid contract address. 

```solidity
function isContract(address account) internal view returns (bool) {
    uint256 size;
    assembly {
        size := extcodesize(account)
    }
    return size > 0;
}

function proposeBaseImplementation(
    address implementation,
    bytes calldata callData
) external requireProposerOrAcceptor {
    if (implementation == address(0) || !isContract(implementation)) revert Forbidden();
    _proposedBaseImplementation = Proposal({
        implementation: implementation,
        callData: callData
    });
    emit BaseImplementationProposed(_proposedBaseImplementation, tx.origin);
}
```
